On Pair Emission in the Proton Bombardment of Fluorine 


The gamma-rays emitted when fluorine is bombarded by 
protons have been studied by Fowler and Lauritsen, who 


have shown that these gamma-rays are monochromatic, 


with an energy of (6.3-40.1) Mev, independent of the 
proton energy; that they are emitted by an excited oxygen 
nucleus formed from the compound nucleus Ne?° by short 
rangé alpha-particle emission; and that they are emitted 
strongly only at certain well-defined proton energies which 
correspond to resonance levels in Ne®*. To account for the 
sharpness of these resonances it has been suggested that the 
parity-angular momentum . selection rule prohibits the 
emission from these states of a long range alpha-particle, 
with the formation of a normal oxygen nucleus. 

Recently Fowler and Lauritsen! have shown that under 
proton bombardment fluorine also emits electron pairs of 
total energy (5.9+0.5) Mev. The excitation function for 
the pairs also exhibits resonances, but: uncorrelated with 
those for the gamma-rays—at some energies there are 
more than 100 times as many gamma-rays as pairs; at 
others the number of gamma-rays is comparable with, and 
may be smaller than, the number of pairs. Since, for any 
multipole order the pair creation internal conversion 
coefficient for 6-Mev gamma-rays is less than half of one 
percent, the pair emission must arise from a nuclear 
transition for which gamma-radiation is strictly forbidden, 
i.e., either Ne?® or O!8% possesses an excited state with 
j=0 with no lower states of nonvanishing j, from which 
these pairs must originate. Since Ne?® is known from the 
work of Bonner to have a number of low-lying excited 
states, we are led to ascribe the pairs to a transition from an 
excited state of oxygen, with 7=0 and about 6 Mev 
excitation energy, to the ground state. 

If long range alpha-particle emission from the corre- 
sponding Ne? is to be forbidden by the parity-angular

momentum selection rule, this state in oxygen must be of 
odd parity (0-). A (0-->0*) transition, however, corre- 
sponds to vanishing matrix elements of charge and current 
density ; decay by pair emission can only occur if there is a 
nonelectromagnetic coupling between nuclear particles and 
the pair field. Thus, a coupling term of the form suggested 
by the Gamow-Teller, theory of nuclear forces, 


— Ge1-G prot) or (el-Fneut); 


would permit this transition to occur with the emission of 
pairs. A value of the coupling constant much smaller than 
that suggested by these authors would be sufficient to give 
a rate of pair emission greater than the rate of the com- 
petitive process of two-quantum emission. This latter 
process takes place by the successive emission of an 
electric dipole and a magnetic dipole quantum, through the 
intermediary of states possessing the character 1* or 17. 
The lifetime of the 07 state associated with this method of 
decay may be roughly estimated at 10-6 sec. 

The only alternative to this radical suggestion is to 
assume the excited state in oxygen to be of even parity 
(0+). Pair emission, no longer forbidden, proceeds at the 


rate: 
| e? 2 7 
Gaels, (=) | (Yexe, 2r?ynorm) ie 


which exceeds the rate of two-quantum emission: 


() (2) ( ; “ -) (=) () I(Yese, C22 PY norm) [2 


since y, the energy emitted in the transition, is rather less 
than A (~20 Mev), the mean energy difference between the 
ground state and the excited states of type 1~ which act as 
intermediates in the double electric dipole emission 
process. (The summation in these formulae is to be 
extended over all nuclear protons.) The quanta would give 
a weak continuous spectrum extending up to 6 Mev and 
would not have been observed. 

This second alternative involves abandoning the expla- 
nation of the long life of the resonance states of Ne? in 
terms of the parity-angular momentum selection rule. 
Neither spin nor isotopic spin conservation can ‘appreciably 
reduce the probability of long range alpha-particle emis- 
sion. Indeed, if the first excited state of O18 is 0+, it would 
seem likely on the basis of the alpha-particle model, which 
could make this intelligible, that this state has the same 
spin and isotopic spin as the ground state. For this reason 
we must expect the yield of long range alpha-particles to 
show resonance at the energies which produce pairs. Some 
indication that this may be so is afforded by the fact that 
the maximum pair yield found by Fowler and Lauritsen 
is under a tenth of the maximum gamma-ray yield, which 
suggests that the emission of long range alpha-particles 
competes with the alpha-particle emission leading to the 
excited state. We should in fact expect that at bombarding 
energies of the order of 1 Mev, where pair emission becomes 
appreciable, the Coulomb barrier would not materially 
reduce the emission probability of even the short range 
alpha-particles. The value of 10 to 1 suggested by the 
observed yield of pairs for the ratio of the decay rates of 


LETTERS TO 


long and short range alpha-particles is thus a reasonable 
one. The fact that the gamma-ray yields are larger, and, 
near the 330-kev resonance, much larger than the yield of 
long range alpha-particles, makes it necessary to assume 
that, at least for this y-ray resonance, the long range alpha- 
emission is either forbidden or reduced. 

If then the excited state is even, we should expect the 
resonance yield of long range alpha-particles to be com- 
parable with, and probably considerably greater than the 
yield of pairs. If this is not so, the pair emission itself would 
seem to provide strong evidence for a nonelectromagnetic 
coupling between electrons and heavy particles.

Observation of the Spectrum of Ne V 


Previous investigations of the spectra of rare gases! have 
been limited in the extent of ionization which was produced 
in the gas atom. The development of methods of study of 
atoms which can be fixed in an electrode in solid form has 
extended the spectra of such ions to far greater stages of 
ionization. In an attempt to close some of the gaps in 
isoelectronic sequence data, experiments have been under- 
taken to determine whether higher stages of ionization 
can be studied in the rare gases. This communication is a 
preliminary report of some observations of the spectra of 
neon. _ | 

A periodic disruptive discharge in neon gas enclosed in 
Pyrex and quartz capillaries of about 2 mm bore and 15 mm 
length has been used as a source of light on a 3-meter 
grazing incidence vacuum spectrograph. On the resulting 
spectrograms the principal lines of Ne III, Ne IV; and 
Ne V have been identified. 

The wave-lengths of the lines attributed to Ne V are 
given in Table I. The identification seems certain inasmuch 
as the lines are well isolated on the plates and their positions 
can be predicted with good accuracy from isoelectronic 
sequence data. The wave-lengths given must be regarded as 
tentative as they may be in error by as much as 0.05A 
because of the scarcity of standard lines on the plate from 
which the measurements were taken. 

It is expected that refinements of experimental technique 
will permit fuller development of the spectrum of Ne V 
and more accurate wave-length measurements. Since the 
lines due to Ne V are equally as strong as those due. to 
Ne III and Ne IV on the present plates, it is possible that

Work Functions of Different Faces of Silver Single Crystals 


The work functions of the (100) and (111) faces of silver 
single crystals have been determined by a photoelectric. 
method after extended outgassing of the crystals in a high 
vacuum. The crystal faces were prepared by a method 
described previously.! The equilibrium value of the work 
function for the (100) face is 4.81 0.01 electron volts. This 
value was obtained after 2283 hours of heating at various 
temperatures up to visible red heat. 356 hours of additional 
heating did not change this value. After the crystal had 
subsequently remained at room temperature for 2130 hours, 
at a pressure of 1 to 3X1078 mm Hg, the work function 
decreased to 4.65 ev. After 100 hours of additional heating 
of the crystal the work function increased to 4.79 ev, and 
after an additional 118 hours of heating it returned to the 
equilibrium value of 4.81 ev. — 

The equilibrium value of 4.75 +-0.01 ev fog the (111) face 
was obtained after 1227 hours of heating at temperatures 
similar to those above. This crystal had been outgassed in 
two previous experiments so that a much shorter time was. 
required to reach the equilibrium value of the work 
function than for the (100) face. The above equilibrium 
value was not changed by 407 hours of additional heating. 
At this time the crystal became slightly contaminated 
while heating a tantalum plate near it. The effect of the 
contamination was to cause a failure of the experimental 
results to fit the Fowler theoretical curve. 

Measurements of the contact potential difference, by the 
Kelvin null method, between the two crystal faces at 
frequent intervals during outgassing agreed with the 
differences of the photoelectric work functions to within 
+0.01 volt until the results for the (111) face failed to fit 
the Fowler theoretical curve. 

We believe that these values are the best that can be 
obtained by heating since silver crystals etch rapidly, thus 
exposing other faces, when heated at temperatures where 
appreciable evaporation occurs.? The above values may be 
compared with 4.74 ev, previously obtained by Winch,? for 
polycrystalline silver after heating for 1200 hours which 
included short intervals at temperatures as high as 850°C 
where evaporation is rapid.
