GRAVITATIONAL CONTRACTION 


densed neutron phase would start at the center. 
By reason of the greater density of the con- 
densed phase, the star will begin to collapse. 
The details of this process are difficult to analyze 
without knowing the change of density and the 
heat of condensation (latent heat of evapora- 
tion). If the latter one can be neglected beside 


the regular energy liberation in the stellar — 


interior, collapsing can go on until a very thin 
neutron atmosphere is left around the con- 
densed neutron core. This hypothesis affords a

analysis of this problem must await a great deal

On Continued Gravitational Contraction 


J. R. OPPENHEIMER AND H. SNYDER 
University of California, Berkeley, California 


(Received July 10, 1939) 


When all thermonuclear sources of energy are exhausted a sufficiently heavy star will 
collapse. Unless fission due to rotation, the radiation of mass, or the blowing off of mass by 
radiation, reduce the star’s mass to the order of that of the sun, this contraction will continue 
indefinitely. In the present paper we study the solutions of the gravitational field equations 
which describe this process. In I, general and qualitative arguments are given on the 
behavior of the metrical tensor as the contraction progresses: the radius of the star ap- 
proaches asymptotically its gravitational radius; light from the surface of the star is pro- 
gressively reddened, and can escape over a progressively narrower range of angles. In IJ, an 
analytic solution of the field equations confirming these general arguments is obtained for the 
case that the pressure within the star can be neglected. The total time of collapse for an ob- 
server comoving with the stellar matter is finite, and for this idealized case and typical stellar 
masses, of the order of a day; an external observer sees the star asymptotically shrinking to 


its gravitational radius.

ECENTLY it has been shown! that the 
general relativistic field equations do not 
possess any static solutions for a spherical 
distribution of cold neutrons if the total mass of 
the neutrons is greater than ~0.7©. It seems of 
interest to investigate the behavior of nonstatic 
solutions of the field equations. 

In this work we will be concerned with stars 
which have large masses, >0.7©, and which 
have used up their nuclear sources of energy. A 
star under these circumstances would collapse 
under the influence of its gravitational field and 
release energy. This energy could be divided into 
four parts: (1) kinetic energy of motion of the

particles in the star, (2) radiation, (3) potential 
and kinetic energy of the outer layers of the star 
which could be blown away by the radiation, 
(4) rotational energy which could divide the 
star into two or more parts. If the mass of the 
original star were sufficiently small, or if enough 
of the star could be blown from the surface by 
radiation, or lost directly in radiation, or if the 
angular momentum of the star were great enough 
to split it into small fragments, then the re- 
maining matter could form a stable static 
distribution, a white dwarf star. We consider the 
case where this cannot happen. 

If then, for the late stages of contraction, we 
can neglect the gravitational effect of any 
escaping radiation or matter, and may still 
neglect the deviations from spherical symmetry

produced by rotation, the line element outside 
the boundary 7 of the stellar matter must take 
the form 


ds* = e’di? — edr? — 7?(dé?+ sin? Od¢") (1): 


with e’=(1—17)/r) 


ed = (1 = ro/r)—. 


Here 7p is the gravitational radius, connected 
with the gravitational mass m of the star by 
ro =2meg/c?, and constant. We should now expect 
that since the pressure of the stellar matter is 
insufficient to support it against its own gravi- 
tational attraction, the star will contract, and its 
boundary 7% will necessarily approach the gravi- 
tational radius 7>. Near the surface of the star, 
where the pressure must in any case be low, we 
should expect to have a local observer see matter 
falling inward with a velocity very close to that 
of light ; to a distant observer this motion will be 
slowed up by.a factor (1—70/m). All energy 
emitted outward from the surface of the star 
will be reduced very much in escaping, by the 
Doppler effect from the receding source, by the 
large gravitational red-shift, (1—70/7)*?, and by 
the gravitational deflection of light which will 
prevent the escape of radiation except through a 
cone about the outward normal of progressively 
shrinking aperture as the star contracts. The star 
thus tends to close itself off from any communi- 
cation with a distant observer; only its gravi- 
tational field persists. We shall see later that 
although it takes, from the point of view of a 
distant observer, an infinite time for this 
asymptotic isolation to be established, for an 
observer comoving with the stellar matter this 
time is finite and may be quite short. 

Inside the star we shall still suppose that the 
matter is spherically distributed. We may then 
take the line element in the form (1). For this 
line element the field equations are 


—8rT =e (ry /r+1/r?) -—1/r’, (2)

respect to 7 and dots differentiation with respect 
to ¢. 

The energy-momentum tensor 7,“ is composed 
of two parts: (1) a material part due to electrons, 
protons, neutrons and other nuclei, (2) radi- 
ation. The material part may be thought of as 
that of a fluid which is moving in a radial 
direction, and which in comoving coordinates 
would have a definite relation between the 
pressure, density, and temperature. The radi- 
ation may be considered to be in equilibrium 
with the matter at this temperature, except for a 
flow of radiation due to a temperature gradient. 

We have been unable to integrate these equa- 
tions except when we place the pressure equal to 
zero. However, one can obtain some information 
about the solutions from inequalities implied by 
the differential equations and from conditions 
for regularity of the solutions. From Eqs. (2) and 
(3) one can see that unless \ vanishes at least 
as rapidly as 7? when 7-0, T.4 will become 
singular and that either or both 7! and v’ will 
become singular. Physically such a singularity 
would mean that the expression used for the 
energy-momentum tensor does not take account 
of some essential physical fact which would 
really smooth the singularity out. Further, a star 
in its early stage of development would not 
possess a singular density or pressure; it is 
impossible for a singularity to develop in a finite 
time. 

If, therefore, \(r=0) =0, we can express A in 
terms of 7,‘, for, integrating Eq. (3) 


Sr 
A= —In {1-— f revar|, (6) 
reo 


Therefore \2 0 for all 7 since 7,42 0. 
Now that we know \2 0, it is easy to obtain 
some information about v’ from Eq. (2); 


y’ 20, (7) 


since \ and —T7}! are equal to or greater than 
zero. 

If we use clock time at r= «, we may take 
v(y= 0)=(0. From this boundary condition and 
Eq. (7) we deduce 

vy <0. (8) 


‘The condition that space be flat for large 7 is 


GRAVITATIONAL CONTRACTION 


A(r= ©) =0. Adding Eqs. (2) and (3) we obtain: 


8r(T a TT) = e(r’ +’) /r, (9) 


Since 7,‘ is greater than zero and 7! is less than 
zero we conclude 


N+y'2 0. (10) 


Because of the boundary conditions on \ and » 
we have 
| A+r <0 (11) 


For those parts of the star which are collapsing, 
i.e., all parts of the star except those being blown 
away by the radiation, Eq. (5) tells us that } is 
greater than zero. Since \ increases with time, it 
may (a) approach an asymptotic value uniformly 
as a function of 7; or (b) increase indefinitely, 
although certainly not uniformly as a function of 
ry, since \(r=0)=0. If X were to approach a 
limiting value the star would be approaching a 
stationary state. However, we are supposing that 
the relationships between the 7," do not admit 
any stationary solutions, and therefore exclude 
this possibility. Under case (b) we might expect 
that for any value of r greater than zero, d will 
become greater than any preassigned value if ¢ is 
sufficiently large. If this were so the volume of 
the star 

rb 

Vader f er!2y 2dr (12)

would increase indefinitely with time; since the 
mass is constant, the mean density in the star 
would tend to zero. We shall see, however, that 
for all values of r except 7», \ approaches a finite 
limiting value; only for r=r, does it increase 
indefinitely. 


I] 


To investigate this question we will solve the 
field equations with the limiting form of the 
energy-momentum tensor in which the pressure 
is zero. When the pressure vanishes there are no 
static solutions to the field equations except 
when all components of 7,# vanish. With p=0 we 
have the free gravitational collapse of the matter. 
We believe that the general features of the 
solution obtained this way give a valid indication 
even for the case that the pressure is not zero, 
provided that the mass is great enough to cause 
collapse. 


457 


For the solution of this problem, we have 
found it convenient to follow the earlier work of 
Tolman? and use another system of coordinates, 
which are comoving with the matter. After 
finding a solution, we will introduce a coordinate 
transformation to put thelineelement in form (1). 

We take a line element of the form: 


ds* = dr* —e*d R? —e*(dé*+sin? Ody”). (13) 


Because the coordinates are comoving with the 


matter and the pressure is zero, 
T 4 =p (14) 


and all other components of the energy mo- 
mentum tensor vanish. 
The field equations are:

The solution of this equation is: 


e = (Fr+G)43, (21) 


in which F and G are arbitrary functions of R. 
The substitution of (19) in (16) gives a result 
equivalent to (20). Therefore the solution of the 
field equations is (21). 
For the density we obtain from (17), (19), 
and (21) 


Srp =4/3(r +G/F)(7r+G'/F’)-. (22) 


There is less real freedom in (21) than is 
apparent from the two arbitrary functions F and 
G; for taking R a function of a new variable 
R* the differential equations (15), (17) and (18) 
will remain of the same form. We may therefore 
choose 


G= Ri, (23) 


At a particular time, say r equal zero, we may 
assign the density as a function of R. Eq. (22) 
then becomes a first-order differential equation 
for F. 


FF! =9nRpo(R). (24) 


The solution of this equation contains only one 

arbitrary constant. We now see that the effect of 

setting f?(R) equal to one allows us to assign 

only a one-parameter family of functions for the 

initial values of 9, whereas in general one should 

be abletoassign the initial values of fo arbitrarily. 
We now take, as a particular case of (24):

We wish to find a coordinate transformation 
which will change the line element into form (1). 
It is clear, by comparison of (1) and (13), that 

we must take

Here (30) is a first-order partial differential 
equation for ¢t. Using the values of 7 given by (27),

we find:

where L and M are completely arbitrary func-

Outside the star, where Ris greater than Ry, we 
wish the line element to be of the Schwartzchild 
form, since we are again neglecting the gravi- 
tational. effect of any escaping radiation; thus 


e=(1—79/r)7 (33) 
e’=(1—71r9/r). (34) 


This requirement fixes the form of L; from 
(28) we can show that we must take L(x) =x, or 


(35) 


At the surface of the star, R equal Ry, we must 
have L equal to M for all r. The form of M is

From this relation we see that for a fixed

time ro an observer comoving with the matter 
would not be able to send a light signal from the 
star; the cone within which a signal can escape 
has closed entirely. For a star which has an 
initial density of one gram per cubic centimeter

For R less than R,, e tends to a finite limit as #

infinity like e'/"° as t approaches infinity. Where 
R is less than Rz, e’ tends to zero like e~*4/"? and 
where R is equal to Rb, e’ tends to zero like e~*/”°, 

This quantitative account of the behavior of 
e’ and e” can supplement the qualitative dis- 
cussion given in J. For \ tends to a finite limit 
for 7<7ro as t approaches infinity, and for r=7

infinity. We expect that this behavior will be 
realized by all collapsing stars which cannot end 
in a stable stationary state. Of course, actual 
stars would collapse more slowly than the 
example which we studied analytically because 
of the effect of the pressure of matter, of radi- 
ation, and of rotation.

Formation of Ions in the Cyclotron 


| ROBERT R. WiLson 
Radtation Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California 
(Received July 10, 1939) 


Measurements of the initial ionization in a cyclotron, produced by the use of a filament, as a 
function of the pressure, electron emission, and dee voltage are presented. The amount of 
ionization is found to be too high to be simply explained by an electron passing between the 
region between dees only once. A theory is proposed wherein some of the electrons are caught 
by the changing electric field between the dees and oscillate back and forth many times during a 
cycle of the dee voltage. Experimental observations which conform to the theory are described. 


HE manner of formation of the initial ions 


in a cyclotron is important as it affects the 
intensity and homogeneity of the high energy 
beam. Ideally the ions should be formed in a 
very small region at the center of cyclotron and 
at the median plane. Livingston, Holloway and 
Baker! have developed a capillary type of ion 
source with these characteristics. However, 
extended filament ion sources are more generally 
used at present because they give larger circu- 
lating currents, and this paper will be concerned

only with an analysis of this type of ion source. 

The usual arrangement is for the filament to be 
located under a shield in which a wide slot is cut 
to permit the electrons to pass up along the lines 
of magnetic force between the dees and so ionize 
by collision the gas in the central region of the 
cyclotron. A potential difference, hereafter re- 
ferred to as the emission voltage, between the 
filament and shield accelerates the electrons from 
the shielded region. 

One is first interested in the magnitude of the 
ionization between the dees caused by the narrow 
beam of electrons. This was measured directly
