ON THE QUANTUM THEORY OF ELECTRONIC IMPACTS! 


By J. R. OPPENHEIMER* 


ABSTRACT 


It is shown that the previous treatment of electronic collisions has been in- 
complete; the error consists in the neglect of terms in the solution which correspond 
to an interchange of the colliding electron with one of those in the atom. The cor- 
rected first order cross section for elastic collisions is evaluated by Dirac’s method 
for atomic hydrogen and helium. The complete solution for hydrogen is set up by 
Born’s method for hydrogen; it is shown that the elastic cross section becomes 
infinite, for low velocities, with the reciprocal of the velocity; it is further shown 
that the first order cross section reduces to that already obtained. For hydrogen 
this is a monotonically increasing function; for atoms with completely paired: elec- 
trons the monotonic increase is broken by a minimum at velocities corresponding to 
about a volt; the higher the azimuthal quantum number of the paired valence elec- 
trons, the more marked the minimum, and the lower the voltage at which it occurs. 


HERE are at present two methods of treating the collision ofan electron 
with an atom. In the one calculation? one solves the transformation equa- 
tion from the time to a set of constants of integration specifying the state 
of the atom and the components of momentum of the electron; and by choos- 
ing a solution which represents the atom initially in its normal state, anda free 
electron wave of unit intensity per unit time per unit area, one may obtain 
transition probabilities which give directly the cross section for an encounter 
of any specified type. In the second method? one obtains a solution of the 
stationary Schroedinger equation for the coupled system of atom and 
~electron, combines the solutions to represent an incident wave ot unit in- 
tensity per unit area impinging upon the unexcited atom, and interprets the 
scattered wave by means of a flux vector. In the former method one thus 
computes the rate of increase of the probability that the system is in the 
final state in question; in the second one finds the rate at which electrons 
leave the atom in this state; and since it follows from the normalization of 
the wave functions for this state that these two rates are equal,’ the two meth- 
ods are equivalent. The former method is more convenient for the estimation 
of first order cross sections; the latter for low velocity encounters, where the 
properties of the exact solution are important. 
The first order problem has been solved explicitly for the collision of an 
electron with a hydrogen atom.> The cross section for elastic collision so

obtained is a monotonic function of the electronic velocity, and increases 
uniformly to a finite limit—the gas kinetic cross section—as the velocity is 
diminished. This calculation would indicate that for hydrogen there should 
be no Ramsauer effect, and no secondary maxima in the angular distribution 
of the scattered electrons. | 

Before the development of the quantum mechanics, Elsasser suggested® 
that these effects might be interpreted as the diffraction by the atom of the 
long de Broglie waves of the electron, and predicted that the elastic cross 
section should vanish with the fourth power of the electronic velocity. This 
argument is, however, incorrect. In the first place, as we shall show, the atom 
does not behave, even for slow collisions, as a rigid body: all the atomic 
characteristics are excited. In the second place Mensing showed’ that, even 
for an especially favorable atomic model, the cross section does not vanish 
in the limit; this is because the refractive index within the atom is not, as 
in the optical case, nearly a constant, but varies instead with the reciprocal 
of the velocity. In the course of this work we shall see that the cross section 
does not become infinite faster than the reciprocal of the velocity; it is not 
possible to prove that it remains finite nor that it vanishes. 

All of the work on collisions has, however, been incomplete. Analytically, 
this incompleteness is the result of neglecting, in the former method of 
treating the problem, transitions to states in which atomic and impacting 
electrons are interchanged; and, in the latter method, the excitation of the 
continuous spectrum. If one does not neglect these effects, he finds that, 
for a given atom, there is not one, but a series of elastic cross sections, cor- 
responding to wave functions of differing symmetry in the orbital coordinates 
of the electrons in the atom and the colliding electron. Thus for hydrogen 
there are two cross sections, one for symmetric waves, one for waves anti- 
symmetric in the coordinates of the two electrons. In general all cross sec- 
tions approach, for high velocity encounters, those computed with neglect 
of the resonance terms; for low velocities there are characteristic deviations, 
which make the angular distribution of the scattered electrons irregular, 
and the total elastic cross section pass, in certain cases, through a minimum, 
instead of increasing monotonically with decreasing velocity. 

In this paper we shall first compute by the former of the two methods 
the first order cross section for encounters with a hydrogen atom. We shall 
then set up the general equations for the collision by the second method, and 
show how the solutions are to be interpreted physically. We shall investi- 
gate the behavior of the elastic cross section for extremely low velocities; 
and we shal! also show that the equations lead to a first order cross section 
identical with that found by the former method. We shall apply this to 
obtain the first order cross sections for hydrogen and helium, although these 
are of no quantitative significance; for the calculation itself shows the first 
approximation to be inadequate for low velocity encounters, and the full

calculations appear impossible. We shall indicate, however, the physical 
predictions to be made on the basis of the theory, and obtain a few qualitative 
results for more complex atoms. 

2. If we neglect the interaction of the Som and electron, we may de- 
scribe the system by giving numerical values to six first integrals: the 
quantum numbers of the atom u, k, m, and the three electronic constants, — 
v, 0, 6, which are defined in terms of the cartesian components of the elec- 
tronic momentum by the relations: 


y=(2Mb)-[p.2+p,2-+p.2] 3 O=tan-(p.2+p,)/p,; o=tan—p,/ps, (1) 


where WM is the reduced electronic mass. To each set of values of these six 
integrals we shall be able to assign two linearly independent wave functions; 
in particular these may be chosen respectively symmetric and antisymmetric 
in the coordinates of the two electrons. If they are so chosen, then a wave 
function initially symmetric will give rise, during the collision, only to sym- 
metric waves; one initially antisymmetric will produce only antisymmetric 
waves: for the interaction energy is of course symmetric. If now one solves 
the transformation equation from this set of integrals to the time, he finds, 
for the first order cross sections? 


onum(v’ 0,6) = (42/h?) | V(n, k,m,v’ ,0,¢) |? (2) 


where pv’ and x are connected with the initial value of », »y say, by the relation 
y—v'—R+Rn’*=0 where R is Rydberg’s constant 27?Met/h®. Here Vy 
(n, k, m,v', 0, 6) and V_-(n, k, m, v’, 6, @) are the matrix components of the 
interaction energy for a transition from the initial wave function, which has 


n=1, k=0, m=0, v=v, 0=0 


to a wave function with n, k, m, v’, 0, 6; and the wave functions are in the ~ 
two cases respectively symmetric and antisymmetric. 

These matrix components may readily be written down, although one can- 
not give explicitly the corresponding operator in coordinate space. If r; and 
r2 are the vectors from the atomic center of gravity to the two electrons, and 
Wnim the normalized hydrogen wave functions, and x,0, the normalized 
functions for the free electron, then the wave functions normalized to dy 
are for the two cases respectively

so that we get for the elastic cross section 
o(v’ 0,6) = (402/h?) | f(v',0,4) £00’, 0,4) |? (7) 


An obvious difficulty may perhaps be mentioned here. The functions 
y are all orthogonal to each other, and so are the functions x; but the y’s 
are orthogonal to the. x’s only in the sense of continuous spectra:

This is because wy and y satisfy different wave equations. The non- 
orthogonality is negligible for high velocities, but for slow encounters it may 
introduce a serious ambiguity. One may overcome this in principle by using 
in place of the x’s, the corresponding wave functions for the hyperbolic 
orbits of the hydrogen atom; and for high velocities this would give the same 
result as (7). But again for low velocities it would introduce a serious error 
into the first order cross section; for the two terms in the interaction energy 
which do in fact nearly neutralize each other would here be treated unsym- 
metrically; and the resulting cross section would turn out too large. We shall 
meet the same difficulty in a somewhat different form in 3. 

By considering the secondary waves whose amplitude does not increase 
steadily with the time, one may solve the transformation equations correctly 
to a higher order; and the difficulty in the choice of proper orthogonal initial 
_ wave functions would then disappear. But this method is in practice less 

suited to the exact solution of the problem than that of Born. ,

If one considers a linear combination, Y say, of the solutions (9), he sees 
that this involves some terms quadratically nonintegrable in 71, some quad- 
ratically nonintegrable in 72, and, for sufficiently large E, some quadratically 
integrable in neither 7; nor 72... Now for each pair of terms in y and w* quad- 
ratically nonintegrable in 71, there will correspond two waves in m-space, 
one approaching, the other receding, from the atom. One may then combine 
the solutions (9) with different u’s in such a way that there is no ingoing 
wave in 7;-space to correspond to an excited or quadratically nonintegrable 
wave in /e-space, and that the ingoing wave in rj-space corresponding to 
the wave function of the unexcited atom in /2-space represents a stream of 
electrons moving parallel to z, of $ electron per unit time per unit area. The 
incident wave will then have asymptotically the same form as that of

The constants D vanish for »<3R/4; the constants F vanish forv<R.

10 In a recent paper (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 13, 800, 1927) the collision problem was con- 
sidered, to obtain an estimate of the-cross section for excitation when the electronic voltage 
approaches the resonance potential, in order to prove that in this limit the polarization of the 
excited light tends to vanish. In this treatment the continuous spectrum of the atom was neg- 
lected; and the treatment is therefore as it stands invalid. If one considers the continuous 
spectrum, one may in fact show that the polarization will tend to fall far below its value given 
by the momentum rules; it does not appear possible to show in general that it vanishes. Per- 
haps we may state the physical grounds for the failure of the momentum rule in an elementary 
way: when, as in the derivation of the momentum rules, the effect of the atom on the motionof 
the electron after the collision is neglected, only those electrons with vanishing angular momen- 
tum will have, in the limit, an appreciable chance of being near the atom; conversely, in this 
limit, the electron will have no appreciable chance of carrying away angular momentum; and 
this, since the electron initially had no angular momentum about the direction of the electron 
beam, at once gives, by the conservation theorem, the momentum rules. But when the 
influence of the atom on the final wave function for the electron is taken into account—and 
it is of capital importance in the limit when the electronic voltage approaches the resonance 
potential, the situation is changed; for now an electron with finite angular momentum can be 
near the atom; conversely the electron can now take up, and in general will take up, momentum 
from the atom; and thus excitations forbidden by the momentum rule will occur. It may 
be added that this modification does not affect at all the second part of the paper quoted, 
which is concerned with the anomalous polarization of the intercombination lines.

In each case there is a cross section corresponding to waves initially sym- 
metric, and one corresponding to waves initially antisymmetric, in the orbital 
coordinates of the electrons. We shall consider this solution in detail for the 
case vy <3R. 

For this case the wave

will involve only one set of waves quadratically nonintegrable in re. For 
both Knrm(re) and Ky km(re) vanish as 72 ,sincethe V’s fall off atleast with 
1/r, and the w’s are bounded uniformly in r. Thus the equations for the u’s 
take the asymptotic form 


[A+An |unkm=0 An = (842M /h)(v—R+Rn-*) 


(10c) 
[A+Ap + e?/r |utytnm =O. Ayr = (84?M/h)(v—R—v') 


And for all the u’s except u199 the parameter A is negative; the corresponding 
solutions will therefore be uniformly quadratically integrable; only w1o9 will 
involve waves which extend to infinity. 

Similarly, there will be only one set of waves quadratically nonintegrable 
in 7. For in the first place all the functions for the discrete states, Warm; 
fall off exponentially. And although the functions y,/;m are quadratically 
nonintegrable, the coefficients w,/;m are uniformly bounded in yv and 72 
except in the immediate neighborhood of v’ =v. To see this we may examine 
more closely the equations (10) for the w’s. If we take the second term in the 
expression for K,-%m, we see that it is an improper integral; for in the nucleus 
for v’’ =p’, the term 


f de! | Wrem(t’) [2¢2/ | r—r" | 


does not exist. We may, however, modify the work to get rid of this difficulty. 
The physical reason for the modification will be made evident when we con- 
sider the interpretation of the waves. Let us expand the solution y in terms 
of the Warm’s, as before, but replace tHe WV» kms by the solutions ¢,'x4m of the 
differential equation

so that by going to the limit Bo in the final expressions for the cross 
sections, we shall obtain the solutions (9). For finite B the solutions will 
now have the ¢y-zm in place of the ¥,-xm in (9), the w’s will be given by (10), 
and for the K’s we shall have the proper integral

Now the inhomogeneous terms K will be bounded. And unless

where / is integral, the inhomogeneous equations will have bounded solutions. 
But since 


y—R—y'<—R/4 
only for /=1 will the homogeneous equation be soluble, and only for this 


value of v’ will the amplitude of the solution of the inhomogeneous equation 
become infinite. The integral in (17) thus has the form

where Z is a function bounded in v’ and 7,.. Now the first term of (21) gives 
a wave in 7, which is quadratically integrable, since it is expansible in terms 


of the ¢’s with uniformly bounded coefficients. The second term gives at

with the B’s and 7’s real. As we shall show, the Bxm and Tom may be 
determined in terms of the By xrm and Tirm by the wave equation (10a). 
(See (36) and (37)). Further the x’s are determined in these terms by (19) 
and (23). Finally the remaining w’s are determined; for the corresponding 
homogeneous equations have no solution, and the inhomogeneous terms 
depend only on the B’s and 7’s and x’s. For the case »<3R/4, then, 
the solution is completely given in terms of the two sets of constants Byam 
and 7:%m; and these must be chosen to make the incident wave of the 
solutions (9) one of unit intensity per unit area:

This yields at once the elastic cross section. Of this we have to show (a) 
that in the limit v0 it grows in general with v~!; and (b) that in first order 
it reduces to (7). 

The physical interpretation of the waves (9), (13), is immediate. In 
spite of the fact that the atom cannot be excited or ionized by the collision 
without violation of the energy theorem, the wave functions for such excita- 
tion do not in general vanish identically; instead they fall off rapidly as the 
nonatomic electron recedes from the atom, so that the chance of finding 
the atom excited or ionized is only then considerable when another electron 
is in its immediate vicinity. The excitation is thus not permanent; during 
the collision the atom will make quantum jumps; but when the collision is 
over the atom will have returned to its normal state. The electron which 
is left in the normal state is not necessarily the same as was originally there; 
but since one has no way of distinguishing which was originally in the atom, 
it is physically meaningless to ask which has escaped. 

The necessity for replacing the y’s by the ¢’s in order to make the integral 
for the K’s exist may be interpreted in this way: the hyperbolic wave func- 
tions W,’zm are not a possible zero order approximation to the motion of the 
ejected electron; for this ejection only takes place when the atom is left 
neutral, and not ionized; and the hyperbolic wave functions do not approach, 
for infinite distance, a linear combination of the waves which represent the 
motion of an electron with the same energy in the field of a neutral atom. 
In the final results the limit B—o should exist.

as used in (43). 
Hence from (27) we find, uniformly in k and m, that if the |ci.m| and 
the arg Ci%m are chosen to satisfy (26) 


| Anm| <Ao7} (52) 
Thus 
| T2(r,0,¢) | <Ao (53) 
and (14) gives for the cross section 
oo(v,0,6)<Av! (54) 


If we had neglected the continuous spectrum, we should have found 
instead that oo approached in the limit a finite constant independent of @ 
and ¢, so that scattering became uniform over all angles. But this result is 
of no physical significance; and since we have used the properties of the wave 
functions to obtain the lowest upper limit for oo that they in general permit, 
we must conclude that in general the cross section grows in accordance with 
(54). | 

When we evaluate oo in first order, we may introduce several simpli- 
fications. In the first place we may neglect the influence of the scattered 
wave on the incoming wave, as this would give a term of second order. 
We may thus satisfy (26) by setting 


Chm = (0/0) Smal Rg )e Pt?) #8 (55) 


Further we may replace the ¢@’s by the p’s, defined by 


ee f ds f sin 040Y am *(8,6)xv0o(4) (56) 


(This amounts to setting B=0), since the validity of the first order calcula- 
tion depends upon neglecting the distinction between the y’s and the x’s, 
and, as pointed out in 2, it is best to use the same functions for both electrons. 
(See further 4.) Finally we may evaluate Kioo and Kyzm by giving the u’s 
their initial values 


Uvkm = Unkm =O (57)

except

Then (23) gives 
Kykm = 2! taht i) dr f de'broo*(eWroolt)n(t’)prim*(2)V(r’,r) (58)

which, with (14), gives

in agreement with (7). 

4. The quantitative estimation of these cross sections has no very pre- 
cise significance. For the p’s are a very bad approximation to the wave func- 
tions for the aperiodic motion of the electrons; they are not orthogonal to the 
y,'s; and they give a cross section which remains finite for v=0, whereas the 
true cross section presumably becomes infinite with v!. This may be shown 
to depend upon the fact that the p’s approach zero for v=0, whereas the 
@’s and presumably the true functions, do not.. Nor can one overcome this 
difficulty by using the ¥’s or the ¢’s for the p’s; in the former case the flux 
vector does not exist, and in the second case it depends essentially, in the 
first order calculation, upon B, and does not approach a limit when Bo. 
These difficulties would disappear in a complete solution, but at present they 
appear analytically inevitable. 

The qualitative characteristics of oo are easy to obtain. The first term f is 


f(v,8,) = f(v,0) = —(e?/8rR) { [1 +0/R-sin26/2]-!+ [1+ (/R) sin? 6/2\-2} (62) 


and is just the term that gives Born’s cross section. The second term cannot 
be written in closed form. For large v it is smaller than f, since 
g<Av$ : (63) 


whereas f falls off only with the inverse square of v. For v=0 we have directly 


go=2(0,0,6) = [ar f de'baoot(e) {2/1 bet | rar" \ Wioo(r) 


= —3¢?/2mR=+6f(0,6) oe

For fixed angle of deflection 6 both f and g decrease monotonically with in- 
creasing v. Thus for each value of 6 there is a value of v for which the two 
terms become equal. These values of v lie within a small range for which v 
corresponds to a few volts. 

The symmetric cross section is always larger than Born’s value. For large 
vy it is nearly equal to this latter; for small v it is 49 times as great. It in- 
creases monotonically with decreasing v. The angular distribution of scat- 
tered electrons varies slowly with v, and there are no secondary maxima. 

The antisymmetric cross section is much larger than Born’s for v=0, and 
nearly equal to it for large v. But in the range in which the functions 
fv, 6) —g(v, 8) have their zeros, it will be smaller than Born’s value; and be- 
cause these values of v lie in a small range, the total cross section 


f dp f sin 6d0co(v, 8) 


has a minimum in this region. In this region also there are secondary maxima 
in the angular distribution of the electrons. 

Had we taken for the normal state of the atom, a P or D, instead of an 
S, term, with wave function, say, respectively 


Wo1o = const €~*/24r cos 8 


W320 = const e~*/3472(3 cos? @—1) 
we should obtain analogous results. But since in this case 
g<Ay?

g<Av? oD) 


for the two functions respectively, the second term will fall off more rapidly 
than for the S state, and the zeros of f-g will thus occur for lower values of v. 
And since they will also occur within a smaller range, the minimum in the 
total cross section will be more marked. Quite generally, the lower the posi- 
tion of the minimum, the sharper it will be. For @ enters the cross section 
only in the form of ) so that, the lower the velocity, the slighter the 
dependence of f and g upon #, and the smaller the range of velocities in which »

5. If there were no electronic spin, we should have to take, to satisfy 
the exclusion principle, the orbitally antisymmetric solution for the collision 
of an electron with a hydrogen atom; and this would lead to a cross section 
which had a minimum as a function of v. But because of the electron spin 
the symmetric solution will occur with a third the weight of the antisym- 
metric one; so that the total first order cross section for atomic hydrogen is

The total cross section can thus never fall much under Born’s value, and for 
low velocities it will be larger. Thus the theory leads to the prediction that 
atomic hydrogen, and probably the similar alkali atoms, should show no 
Ramsauer effect. 

For other atoms we obtain different results. Thus for helium ne orbital 
wave must be symmetric in two electrons—to correspond to the normal 
state of the atom—and cannot, by the exclusion principle, be symmetric 
in allthree. The two non-combining wave functions corresponding to (3) turn 
out to be 


(a) (01,12) X,og(r3) +eb(r1, 73) Xveg(r2) +e (re, 2s) Xveg(r1)

where (r,r’) =¥(r’, r) is the wave function for the normal state of the atom.” 


1 The functions (68) may be used to compute the excitation probabilities for singlet and 
triplet atomic states; the final wave functions are for the two cases, e.g. in the system (a)

Neither of these vanishes identically. One may obtain a rough idea of the behavior of the cross 
sections by neglecting the coupling of the atomic electrons, and setting ¥(x, y) =Y100(«) Yioo(y),

Here again f gives the classical cross section. And since (69) depends upon 
vy and @ much as (7) does, the theory does give, for helium, a break in the 
monotonic rise of the cross section with decreasing v. In general we can say 
that the ratio of the true cross section to its “classical” value will pass through 
a minimum. Whether the cross section itself passes through a minimum, 
or merely shows a flattening, will depend upon the distribution of zeros of 
f@, 0)—g@, 0). And this effect should occur for all atoms with paired elec- 
trons, and should not occur for an atom with an unpaired electron. Thus 
cadmium should show the break, and sodium should not. But these results 
are based upon the approximately hydrogenic character of the atomic wavé 
functions, and are thus not directly applicable to molecules. 

Since the minimum is more marked for P than for S, for D than for P 
terms, we should expect the effect to be more marked the higher the azi- 
muthal quantum number of the paired valence electrons. And we should 
expect the minimum to occur for a lower voltage the higher the azimuthal 
quantum number 

In conclusion it should be recailed that an adequate quantitative treat- 
ment of the collision problem involves a more complete solution of the equa- 
tions (10) than can as yet, even in the simplest case of atomic hydrogen, be 
given.
