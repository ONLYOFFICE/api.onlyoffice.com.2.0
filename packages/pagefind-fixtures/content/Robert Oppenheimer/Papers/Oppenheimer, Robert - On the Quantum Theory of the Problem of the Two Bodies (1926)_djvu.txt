On the Quantum Theory” of the Problem of the Two Bodies. 
(Preliminary Communication.) By J. R. OPPENHEIMER. (Com- 
municated by Mr R. H. Fow.er.) 


[Read 26 July 1926.] 


The problem of the two bodies has been treated on the new 
mechanics by Dirac*, Paulit, and Schrédinger{, who have inde- 
pendently derived the Balmer terms. The present paper is an 
attempt at a more complete solution. In particular, ‘formulae are 
derived for the line intensities of the hydrogen spectrum, for the 
photoelectric effect and its inverse, and for the continuous absorp- 
tion spectrum in the ultraviolet and in the X-ray regions. Also 
the probabilities of transition, deflection and capture are computed 
for the collision of an electron and an ion. Numerical values are 
only obtained, however, for the simplest line intensities. It is hoped 
to treat the problem in greater detail. 

I. Elliptic Orbits. For the line intensities the system may be 
treated as multiply periodic. We shall assume three degrees of 
freedom, and characterize transitions by six quantum numbers 
(nkm, n’k'm’). The fourth degree of freedom which would follow 
from the existence of an electronic magnetic moment, would not 
affect the intensities of the series lines as wholes. For the emis- 
sion lines we may use the classical formula§ for the intensity in 
which frequencies and amplitudes have been replaced by their — 
quantum theoretic analogues]||. Thus

Averaging again over & and k’ we get the series intensities. In 
ergs per atom per second these give*, for the first and second Lyman 
lines, 0:00667 and 0:000644; for the first and second Balmer lines, 
000789 and 0:00199. The only directly observable ratio is that of 
the second Lyman to first Balmer line. Thus

The evidence in favour of such calculations of absolute intensities 
is not very extensive. Two such calculations were carried through 
on the Correspondence Principle. Thus Tolman} found an approxi- 
mate agreement for the outer lines of a vibration-rotation band in 
the infra red ; and Kramers§ found a rough value for the efficiency 
of an X-ray bulb. 


II. Hyperbolic Orbits. It is possible to extend this method to 
the treatment of hyperbolic orbits. Classically the Fourier 
coefficients for the coordinates do not exist for these orbits. On

the quantum theory the components corresponding to a transition 
between two hyperbolic orbits do not exist and we are forced to 
use the accelerations directly. For photoelectric transitions, how- 
ever, the coordinate components may be found, and the intensities 
are derived from them in accordance with (1). Here, however,

where EF is the positive energy of the hyperbolic orbit. The

For all values of m and k it is possible to find an integral function

From these it follows that

which only fails when £ is zero. 

It is now possible to see in detail how this case differs from 
the periodic one. In the first place it follows from (22) that we can 
no longer choose the constant s, to make

oJolo 


The functions u are thus still orthogonal, but cannot be made 
normal. In the second place, even if we eliminate all values of # 
for which condition 1 is not satisfied, we are left with a continuous 
manifold of characteristic functions. The equations (3) thus become 
meaningless, and must be replaced by

Here the wu, are to be normalized, and the ug chosen to make 
4 (Ekm, nk'm’) = aq! (nk'm’, Ekm)............ (24). 


Finally we may determine f(Z) by the following argument. 
Classically we should have, for the acceleration of the electron 
in an orbit of energy £, 


&_ (EL) = Wee #a (E, v) exp (2aivt) dv, 
and, for the energy radiated from that orbit 
const. ; Bf ze (Ev) exp (2arivt) dv. 


of the problem of the two bodies 427 


Quantum theoretically we have, for the components of acceleration 
corresponding to a photoelectric transition 


u(n) da 


= | Any (nE) @,(nE) u(E) exp [20i(E/h)t]df (E) 


[we suppress the indices & and m throughout this argument]. 
By analogy the radiated energy should be 


const. = | [ee (nF) v>(nE) oy (E)exp [2ri(E/h)t]d(E/h), 
a 0 . 

so that the energy radiated per unit time from the transition

const, 3 [ie (nE) (BE) eal d (Bh) s.s0.++.-(26). 


On the other hand the total radiation from inverse photoelectric 
transitions from an orbit of energy £ is 


const. & & x2 (En) v*(En). 


Of this

is to be ascribed to transitions H ->n. 

Now for the fully excited atom, where all temperature factors 
are ironed out, the number of atoms in any range of phases will 
be proportional to the corresponding volume of phase space. Thus 
if the number of atoms in an elliptic orbit with quantum numbers 
nkm is one, the number with a given m and & and positive energy 
between F and £ + AE is

Thus the number of electrons entering the range of hyperbolic 
orbits per unit time is 
A (E/h). 
This gives, for the condition for detailed equilibrium

We may verify®* this result in part by computing how many 
electrons enter the range of hyperbolic orbits

from a free electron gas with Maxwellian distribution-in-velocity. 
We get 
const. AE. Am. (1 — m?/k?)~ 4 kAk (k? + n2)74 00. (38). 
In the limit of large ( and k) this becomes 
const. AH AmAk (1 — m?*/k?). 
This agrees with the quantum theoretic calculation except for the 


factor (1 — m?/k*)~ 4, The experiment of Stern and Gerlach suggests 
that, in this paradox, the quantum theoretic answer is right. 
In any case (32) gives 


(a) u(n) a, = = &q (nn’) u(n’) + [a (nE) u(E£)d(£+h) 
(0) u(B)a.= & 2a (En'yu(n') + i a (EE yu(E)a(E' + b)| 


to determine u (#) and thus the a, (wZ). Let us call the factor in 
u which remains after division by the normalized functions of $ 
and ¢, u; and let us write 


a=U(E, k; r)=f(E, ks r) x (ER) cece (35). 
From (8) and (6) we get 
r (En) =|. 1, r,u(E).u(n) dr = 15 (En) y (Ek) ...(36).

of the problem of the two bodies 429 


Then we get, from (34), (36), (24) and (37), the integral equation 
for x 


u(n)r— x r (nn’)u (n’) = [ox (Ek) f (Ek; r) 1) (En) d (E/h) 


which is of the form 
| x? (En) Fi (r; En, k, kh’) d(E/h) = F,(r; 0, k’) ...(89).

The existence of a solution (38) independent of r is made plausible 
by the orthogonality of the u(#); the mathematical problem will 
be treated in detail shortly. 

With this notation the continuous absorption spectrum is 
given by

It follows from (22) that the integrals for the components of 
the coordinates corresponding to transitions between two hyper- 
bolic orbits diverge. If we compute the components of the 
acceleration directly from the equations of motion we get

III. Kinematics. From (42) and (46) we can get the probability 
that an electron, entering an hyperbolic orbit, shall be bound to 
the ion in an elliptic orbit, or shall emerge in another hyperbolic 
orbit. These probabilities are equal to the corresponding intensity 
of radiation divided by the energy radiated for a single transition. 
The total probability of capture for an electron of energy H and 
total angular momentum k, averaged over the possible values of m, 
is thus MEP T (he nik

The quantity called, classically, the effective cross-section, is, for 
such electrons

Now. classically the electron approximates more and more 
closely to a free electron as 7 is indefinitely increased. This is not, 
however, true on the new theory. For it is easy to shew, by setting 
e= 0 in (4), that the characteristics for the free electron are

On the other hand (22) gives, for large x, characteristics which 
differ from (52) by having (yr + an’ — hyr) in place of (yr). 

Now it will in general be possible to expand the self adjoint 
characteristics u/p for large r in terms of the characteristics

in space. If if should be possible to expand* it in terms of the 
characteristics of only such electrons as have the same energy, this 
would solve the problem of the deflection spectrum. For the initial 
beam we should have such a sum of characteristics as would give 
an electron moving, say, along the x axis with the initial velocity. 
During the encounter the statistical distribution of the character- 
istics will be changed, in accordance with (46). By analysis of the 
resulting characteristics in terms of the characteristics of free 
electrons with the corresponding final energy moving along the 
three normal directions, we can find the relative probability of any 
deflection and change in energy by the encounter}. This problem 
will be considered in detail. 

I should like to thank Mr R. H. Fowler, F.R.S. and Dr P. A. M. 


Dirac, for many valuable suggestions.
