NOTE ON THE THEORY OF THE INTERACTION 
OF FIELD AND MATTER

ABSTRACT 


The paper develops a method for the systematic integration of the relativistic 
wave equations for the coupling of electrons and protons with each other and with 
the electromagnetic field. It is shown that, when the velocity of light is made infinite, 
these equations reduce to the Schroedinger equation in configuration space for the 
many body problem. It is further shown that it is impossible on the present theory 
to eliminate the interaction of a charge with its own field, and that the theory leads 
to false predictions when it is applied to compute the energy levels and the fre- 
quency of the absorption and emission lines of an atom. 


HE relativistic theory of the interaction of electrons and protons with 

each other and with the electromagnetic field has been developed in two 
papers.! The theory is developed in close analogy to the corresponding class- 
ical theory: the field is on the one hand determined by the configuration of 
the charges; and the motion of the charges is affected by the field. The in- 
teraction between two charges is not then, on this theory, expressed directly 
as a function of the configuration of the charges, but as the effect on each of 
the charges of the field induced by the other. On the classical theory this pro- 
cedure involves grave difficulties, because each charge reacts also with its 
own field. The proper energy of this interaction is, for point charges infinite; 
and it depends upon the motion of the charge. On the classical theory one 
tried to avoid this difficulty by ascribing to the elementary charges a finite 
size; but it was not possible to carry through the theory in a way that was not 
completely arbitrary; nor was it possible to make the work relativistically 
invariant. Oneof the purposes of the present paper is to see in how far these 
difficulties persist in the quantum theory, and in what measure they render 
impossible the application of the theory. 

We may recapitulate briefly the main points of divergence between the 
present quantum theoretic treatment and the classical theory. In the first 
place the state of the matter is here represented, not by a trajectory, but by a 
wave function. Further, the Hamiltonian for the matter is that derived from 
Dirac’s linear wave equation, and not from the quadratic wave equation 
which would follow from the classical relativistic Hamiltonian. Finally, both 
the material waves and the electromagnetic waves are quantized, the matter

to make the particles satisfy the exclusion principle, the field to make the 
quanta satisfy the Einstein-Bose statistics. This precedure leads to a formal 
difficulty; for the fourth Maxwell equation 


div E—4rp=0 (1) 


is inconsistent with the quantum conditions, according to which there are 
functions of the electromagnetic potentials which do not commute with div 
E but which must commute with the charge density. The two papers of 
Heisenberg and Pauli are distinguished chiefly by different methods of re- 
solving this difficulty. In the former paper new terms were added to the 
fourth Maxwell equation to make the new equation consistent with the quan- 
tum conditions; in obtaining physical results these terms were to be made to 
vanish. In the second paper a much more satisfactory method has been used, 
which takes advantage of the fact that the left hand side of (1) is a constant 
of the motion for all systems involving matter and radiation; and it is shown 
that this constancy follows from the gauge invariance of the Hamiltonian 
for all such systems. The solution of the dynamical problem thus reduces to 
finding a wave function for the coupled system of field and matter, which 
makes the Hamiltonian for the coupled system a diagonal matrix, and which 
in addition makes the left hand side of (1) vanish. The wave function has 
thus to satisfy not only the Hamiltonian wave equation, but also a series of 
wave equations which express the fact that (1) is satisfied at all points in 
space. It is from this set of wave equations that we shall start in this paper; 
we shall write them first in the form given in LC Eq. (68), in which the wave 
function is taken as a function of the Cartesian coordinates

vector of propagation K,=(K,, K,?, K,3); K,=v,/c and polarization A, and 
finally a third set of variables P,3, which are essentially the constant com- 
ponents of the electric field parallel to the vectors of propagation K,. We 
shall first show that it is possible to eliminate the P,s’s from the wave equa- 
tions in such a way that (1) is automatically satisfied. The reason why this is 
possible is that the condition (1) determines div E precisely—instead of deter- 
mining only the relative probabilities of different values of div E,—when the 
configuration of the charges is known, so that the values of the P’s so deter- 
mined can be put at once into the Hamiltonian. When this is done the 
variables Q,3 canonically conjugate to the P’s must disappear from the Hamil- 
tonian, since otherwise the Hamiltonian would not be consistent with (1); 


INTERACTION OF FIELD AND MATTER 463 


we shall show that this is in fact the case, and then proceed to an investiga- 
tion of the resulting Hamiltonian. 

It should be observed that the wave functions must satisfy, in addition to 
the wave equations in configuration space, the condition that they be anti- 
symmetric in all the electrons of the system, and antisymmetric in all the 
protons of the system. Only wave functions satisfying these conditions are to 
be considered in this paper; and it will therefore be unnecessary to indicate 
the antisymmetry of the wave functions explicitly. The fact that electrons 
and protons satisfy the exclusion principle is largely irrelevant to the difficul- 
ties discussed in this work;for these difficulties persist even in the one-electron 
problem. On the other hand it is to be hoped that the resolution of the errors 
in the present theory will make the heuristic postulate of the exclusion prin- 
ciple unnecessary. 

We shall look for a solution of the wave equation in which both wave 
function and characteristic values are expanded in powers of v/c. It has al- 
ready been shown by Breit? that, when the interaction of the particles may be 
treated as small, and radiation processes may be neglected, that these inter- 
action terms give a contribution to the energy of the system, which, in second 
order in v/c, agrees with that computed from Breit’s equation.® We shall not 
retain the assumption that the interaction terms are small, and shall show, 
somewhat more generally, that when the proper energy terms are systemat- 
ically neglected, the characteristic energy levels and the wave function are 
determined by Breit’s equation. This equation is, of course, not relativisti- 
cally invariant; and it takes no account of radiation processes. In order to 
remedy these defects one must retain the proper energy terms; and we shall 
show that it is then possible to make a formally satisfactory theory to give the 
shape and position of all spectral lines, and the energy of the normal state. 
The theory, is, however, wrong, since it gives a displacement of the spectral 
lines from the frequency predicted on the basis of the nonrelativistic theory 
which is in general infinite. This displacement arises from the infinite inter- 
action of the electron with itself; this interaction depends upon the state of 
the material system; and the difference in the energy for two different states 
is not in general finite. Thus the present theory gives no more than the non- 
relativisitic theory of Jordan, Klein and Wigner.’ It seems improbable that 
Breit’s equation gives the energy levels of an atom correct to second order 
terms in v/c; but we shall see that there is ground for supposing that it does 
give the separation of the fine structure levels correctly in this order. On the 
other hand the displacement in the frequency of the spectral lines which arises 
from the proper energy should be of the second order in v/c, and is thus larger 
than the natural line breadth, which is of the third order; and on the present 
theory it is not possible to compute this displacement. We shall return later 
to a consideration of these difficulties.

From I we see that the wave function must be singular in the P’s. We may 
avoid the use of singular functions by making a contact transformation from 
the variables P to Q, and writing the wave function as:

The terms for pand p’ different give the electrostatic interaction of the two 
particles; the terms for p=)’ give the infinite electrostatic proper energy of 
the particles; on the present theory it is not possible, as it was on the non- 
relativistic theory,‘ to eliminate these terms; the physical ground for this 
impossibility has already been indicated, and lies in the fact that the field 
acting on any particle is the sum of the fields induced by all particles; it is a 
consequence of the principle of superposition for the field. These electro- 
static proper energy terms do not, however, interfere with the application of 
the theory, since they are constants, and may be dropped from (11) without 
altering the form of the wave function. We shall find other infinite proper

energy terms in the course of the work; but these will turn out not to be con- 
stants, but to depend upon the configuration of the system; dropping them 
does alter the form of the wave function. 

If we now neglect the coupling between matter and the light quantum 
field the wave equation reduces to

We shall show that the terms which we have neglected in (12) are small of the 
order (v/c)?; and by neglecting other terms of the same order, (13) can be 
considerably simplified. For consider first the equation

then any ¢(¢,) in which 2 of the o,’s have either of the values 3 or 4 will be 
small compared with any of the @’s for which all of the o,’s have the values 
1 or 2 of the order (v/c)". Now the terms

are small of the order v/c; thus as v/c is made to vanish, all the solutions of (14) 
vanish except those for which all the o,’s have the values 1 or 2; and (14) 
reduces to

for all ¢,’s=1 or 2 and

which is the Schroedinger equation for the N-body problem.’ It would thus be 
possible to take (18) as the starting point for our systematic solution of (11) 
in powers of v/c. We shall not do this, however, as it would complicate the 
analysis, and lead to no new results. We shall thus give up the assumption 
that the a’s are written in the form (16), and take for our zero’th approxima- 
tion to (11), the solutions of (14).* 

2. We may write the equations (11) sertatem:

etc. 
Now for fixed 7, and fixed K,, 
up? = 0(¢71/2) 
whereas 
vy =O(c). 
7 It is possible to write the two component wave equation when the magnetic interactions 
are retained up to the order (v/c)?, as has been shown by Breit, reference 2. 


* We shall not make explicit use of the fact that the a’s are in the form (16); we shall, how- 
ever, retain the assumption that the a’s are small of the order 2/c, to obtain up” = O(c72), 


INTERACTION OF FIELD AND MATTER 469 


Thus we should expect ¢(1,,) to be small of the order c—*??, #(1,,1,’x') to be 
of the order c~’, and so on, and we should try to find a solution of (11) of the 
form

with 
E™ =0(c-") 


6) (My) =0(c7 7-3 /2M) , 


It should be observed that in general there will be certain frequencies for 
which ¢(1,,), (1, 1,’x’) etc. will not converge uniformly for c—>™ ; and that 
for these frequencies the expansions (19) will be illegitimate. The frequencies 
for which this convergence is non-uniform are those for which 


+k— > Mah, 


ry 
is a characteristic value of the homogeneous equations 
(Ho—d)o=0. (20) 


Such frequencies will not occur if (20) has no solutions for \<F, i.e. if the 
material system is in a normal state; but in general the expansions (19) must 
be modified; we shall return to this modification later, and shall see that it 
gives a satisfactory theory of the absorption and emission of radiation; but for 
the present we shall assume that the atom is in a normal state, so that (19) 
is justified. 

On the present theory there is no normal state for the matter, because 
states of infinite negative energy are possible; one may in fact show that, on 
the present theory, Dirac jumps to such states from states of positive energy, 
jumps in which the energy and momentum lost by the matter are taken up by 
the field, are not only possible, but infinitely probable. But that the theory 
should predict this is a token of an error in the theory; and since the Dirac 
jumps do not seem to be directly responsible for the difficulties with which 
we are, in this work, most concerned, we shall for the present neglect them. 

We shall first give a complete solution for the case that we drop all proper 
energy terms, for the case, that is, that in all double sums of the form 


DF (gp, oP, QP" , Op’) 
PP’ 


we may set the terms with p equal to p’ equal to zero. This solution is not 
unique beyond terms of the second order in v/c; for in the higher orders it is 
no longer possible uniquely to separate proper energy and interaction energy. 
But we may readily obtain a possible solution:

This is the equation used by Breit.’ It is patently not relativistically invariant; 
this means that the proper energy terms are not invariant, and forces us to

retain these terms, at least in part. Furthermore, we have not, in the deduc- 
tion of (28), used the fact that the atom is in its normal state; in spite of this 
there is no sign, in the solution, of processes involving the emission or ab- 
sorption of radiation; for these processes arise from the interaction of the 
particles with their own field. We have, therefore, to consider the solution of 
(11) when the proper energy is not neglected; the retention of these terms will 
preserve the invariance of the theory,and give usan account of radiation proc- 
esses, but it leads to results in contradiction with experiment; it makes the 
validity of (28), even to the second order in v/c, doubtful. 

3. We can readily find a solution of the form (19) when E°and¢°correspond 
to a normal state for the matter; but we cannot find this solution in closed 
form; nor is there an equation in configuration space, corresponding to (28), 
for ¢. If we put (19) in (11.2) etc. we get

The energy level of the normal state is thus infinitely displaced by the 
interaction of the particles with the field; the question which we have now to 
consider is whether or not the energy differences between two states are dis- 
placed by a finite or an infinite amount. 

In order to answer this question we must treat the case of energies which 
do not correspond to a normal state for the matter; and we have to modify 
(19), and take account of the emission of radiation by the system. And for 
this purpose it is convenient to make the dimensions L of the Hohlraum in- 
finite, because that makes the physical interpretation of the solution more 
immediate. For then v, becomes continuous and we may normalize the 
vi™(qgp) to the intervals AvAw, where Aw is the element of solid angle of the 
unit vector e,. Furthermore we may treat here, to simplify the writing, the 
case that # corresponds to the first excited state of the atom, so that there 1s 
only one energy £, lower than £ for which (20) is soluble. 

We define the energy of the normal state by 


-Eyp= Ep + Ep @+ Ey «+ - (35) 


where Ey) and £y“ are given by (31) and (32), and we define the corres- 
ponding wave function 


Uo = bo +49 +49 + - - (36) 


where ¢)™ is given by (31). We can then extend this definition formally to 
obtain the energy and wave function of excited states:

But in the expressions for E, etc, and dm etc, the integrals over vy are now 
improper, and we have to displace the path of integration around the singu- 
larities. This is equivalent to replacing

and then taking the principal value of the integrals over vy. Then in general all 
the E,,’s except Hy are complex. We now transform the ¢(My, qpop) by the

we may determine the radiation incident upon the system. The simplest case 
is that in which only quanta of the single frequency

are incident upon the system, so that all the F’s vanish except

The absorption line is thus of the same shape as that predicted on the basis

Here the principle values are to be taken for all improper integrals over v. 
The terms for p¥)’ are just those to be expected from (33) for the displace- 
ment of the energy levels by the magnetic interaction of the particles. The 
terms

must be ascribed to the effect of the interaction of the particle with its own 


field. They may be compared with the formula obtained? for the same effect 
by Dirac, who finds a displacement 


— [{ w fas ren woe (52)

There does not appear to be any justification for this result, because in its 
derivation terms were neglected that are of the same order as those retained. 
But it is of interest to observe that the integral in (52) exists, and gives a 
finite displacement of the line of the second order in v/c. This displacement 
is thus larger than the natural line breadth, which is of the third order. It can 
be computed® when the uw’s are known. Thus for the first Lyman doublet of 


hydrogen we find the same displacement, in this order, for both components; 
it turns out to be 


ch 1 ch 


3276" Ty 329%7e? 


which is about forty times the line breadth. The fact that this term, and the 
similar terms in (51), are the same, in second order, for the two components 
of the doublet, suggests that the formulae (33) in which the proper energy is 
neglected, will give the atomic fine structure splitting correct to the second 
order. 

If we try to compute the displacement from (51), we find that the in- 
tegrals over v diverge logarithmically for high frequencies. One can readily 


§ The calculations of the displacements predicted by the results of Dirac were carried 
through in collaboration with Harvey Hall; and I am indebted to him for permission to quote 
them here. One must use the retarded potentials to obtain a convergent integral. 


INTERACTION OF FIELD AND MATTER 477 


see that this is not the result of the neglect of higher order terms, nor of any 
of the approximations made in the work. The theory thus leads to the false 
prediction that spectral lines will be infinitely displaced from the values com- 
puted by the Bohr frequency condition. The behavior of the expression (51) 
calls for some comment. As the formula stands, the integral over v diverges 
absolutely; this may be verified by evaluating the terms for a free particle. 
But the question arises whether it is possible so to rearrange the order of 
the integration over »y the summation over n, and the two integrations involved 
in the evaluation of the umn’s by (40), that the limit no, yo exists. 
This cannot be effected by an interchange of the sum over and the integral 
over v; but there is a procedure which, when the E’s in the resonance de- 
nominators of (51) are dropped, does give an absolutely convergent result. 
This procedure was suggested by Heisenberg, who showed that, if we first 
perform the integration over vy and w and the summation over A, then sum 
over all the states n of the same energy, then sum these up to some large but 
finite energy E, take the difference of the two terms for the state (0) and the 
state (1), then perform the two integrations over the configuration space, 
and finally allow E to become infinite, the limit H-2 exists, and (51) tends 
to zero. But if we try to apply this procedure to (51) when the & terms are 
not dropped, we get for the leading term the divergent result 


4e,2/he- (Ey — Ey) /h- dx /x (53) 


Nor is there any method for obtaining an absolutely convergent expression 
for (51). It should be observed that (53) gives us another justification for 
using (33) to get the fine structure separations correct to the second order. 

One can see quite simply that (47) ought not to give a finite line dis- 
placement. For consider two states of a free particle; in one let the particle 
be at rest; in the other let it have the velocity v. Then if the energy of the 
particle at rest be #, the energy of the moving particle in proper coordinates 
moving with the particle will also be &. But we know how this energy 
transforms under a Lorentz transformation; in the original coordinates it 
will be 


EB B=(1-(/c?]” 


and in the same coordinates the difference in energy of the two states, which 
gives the line displacement, will be 

Bee) 
But this can only be finite if & is finite which, by (31), it is not. 

We have treated these difficulties in some detail, because they show that 
the present theory will not be applicable to any problem where relativistic 
effects are important, where, that is, we cannot be guided throughout by the 
limiting case c~0, The theory can thus not be applied to a discussion of the 
structure of the nuclei. It appears improbable that the difficulties discussed in 
this work will be soluble without an adequate theory of the masses of electron 
and proton; nor is it certain that such a theory will be possible on the basis of 
the special theory of relativity.
