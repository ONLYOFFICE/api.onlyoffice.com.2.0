follows from the fact that when we look at the wave equation from the 
calculus of variations standpoint, we know that in the neighborhood 
of the correct ‘‘Higenfunktion” y and the correct ‘“‘Eigenwerte”’ FE, 5E = 0 
for any 6y. Incidentally, this also indicates why the Ritz method seems 
to be a particularly powerful one in calculating the approximate energy 
values of the wave equation.

ON THE QUANTUM THEORY OF THE POLARIZATION OF IM- 
PACT RADIATION 


By J. R. OppENHEIMER* 
JEFFERSON PHYSICAL LABORATORY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY 


Communicated October 26, 1927 


The general theory of the polarization of light excited by electronic 
impact has been given in a previous paper.' In particular, it is shown 
that the polarization computed on the quantum mechanics is independent 
of the axis chosen for describing the directional degeneracy of the atom. — 
It is further shown that, if one neglects the spin of the impacting electron 
and if one assumes that the perturbing interaction energy is small, the 
polarization of the emitted light may be computed ‘‘as if” only those 
states were excited, for which the component of angular momentum in 
a certain direction is the same as in the normal state; and the direction 
is that of the vector difference of the velocities of the incident and scattered 
electron. If this result is applied to electrons with just the necessary 
energy to excite the atom, it yields the momentum rule formulated by 
Skinner; the excitation does not change the component of angular momen- 
tum in the direction of the electron beam. Experimentally? one finds 
that these rules fail in two ways: (1) They do not apply to intercombination 
lines; in particular, they fail conspicuously for radiation from the *S; and 
3P; states of mercury; and (2) the observed polarization tends, as the 
energy of the exciting electron is diminished, first, towards a maximum, 
which in the case of normal lines is proportional to and of the same sign 
as that given by the rule, and, as the energy is further decreased, tends 
to zero. In this paper we shall show that the first of these discrepancies

may be explained when one takes into account the spin of the impacting 
electron and the Heisenberg resonance principle;? and that the second 
follows when one discards the assumption that the perturbing energy is 
small. The theory may thus be made to give a complete account of the 
experimental results. 

We shall first show that, as the velocity of the exciting electron ap- 
proaches that of the resonance potential in question, the polarization of 
the excited line tends to zero. If y,(X) be the wave functions of the 
atom, we may write* the wave function for the system atom + electron:

resonance energy; 7, 0, yg, are the polar codrdinates of the electron with 
the polar axis chosen in the same arbitrary direction as for the atom; 
Y,; are the normalized spherical harmonics; and V is the interaction energy 
of atom and electron. Whenever dj is positive, y,,, will be the amplitude | 
of the probability of the excitation of the state 1, which is associated with 
that electronic wave which behaves asymptotically like

Thus yng) is the amplitude for the excitation which is independent of the

For the non-diagonal terms this is shown in l.c.2. For the diagonal term 
VanXn it follows from the fact that the dipole moment of the atom has no 
diagonal elements; and this excludes only the case of atomic hydrogen, 
which has a first order Stark effect.

This establishes our first point. 

As was explained in 1. c. 1,5 the spin of the exciting electron is important 
only because of Heisenberg’s resonance: there is a chance that the collid- 
ing electron will change places with one of the valence electrons of the 
atom. For normal lines this effect is not important, since in the excita- 
tion of these lines the magnitude of the total spin vector of the system 
will not change; the probability of interchange of electrons will thus be of 
the order of the interaction energy of the spins compared with that of the 
atomic spin and atomic orbit, and this will be negligible. It is thus 
permissible, for these cases, to couple the atomic spin and atomic orbital 
angular momentum before applying the perturbation; and this leads at 
once to Skinner’s rules for the fofal angular momentum of the atom. For 
intercombination excitations the situation is different: the total spin 
vector can only be conserved if the spin of the impacting electron changes 
during the excitation. ‘This form of excitation (A) will be more probable 
than that (3B) in which the atomic coupling remains undisturbed, in the 
same way in which normal transitions are more probable the intercombi- 
nation transitions in an atom. We may thus expect that when a state 
can be excited by (A), the momentum rules will fail, and that the correct

polarization must be computed by coupling spin and angular momentum 
after considering the perturbation; when (A) is impossible, the lines should 
be considerably weaker, and should be polarized in the same way, but not 
so completely, as predicted by the momentum rules.® 

We shall now show how to compute the polarization of lines excited 
by scheme (A). If we treat the collision problem with neglect of all 
spins, we find’ that the component of atomic orbital angular momentum 
parallel to the vector difference of velocities of incident and scattered 
electron remains unchanged by the excitation. We thus know k, s and 
the component in this direction, k,, of k; what we want to know is the 
probability amplitude of 7, k, s,7, = m. For from these amplitudes, for 
given 7 and all m, we can calculate, by the methods of 1. c. 1, the polari- 
zation of the spontaneous radiation from the state j, k, s. ‘Thus we need 
only the transformation functions from the quantities k, s, k,,s, = m — k.,, 
to j, k, s, m. ‘This problem can be solved by the canonical methods of 
the quantum mechanics. For if we can write j as a function of the quan- 
tities k, s, k,, s,, and other quantities whose laws of commutation with 
these are known, then the required amplitude will be given by

are independent of each other, but those of 


(s:/8:), (83/2) and of (Ry/Rz), (Ry/Rs) 
are not. One has thus to average only over the independent phases of 
(s,/sz) and (k,/k;). 
We may apply these results to the case of mercury, which has been 
studied in detail by Skinner.? Let us take first the simple case of the 
3S, states. Here | 7 


ko =0, fj =s' = 1; m’ = +1,0; 
and one readily finds 
| v@, 0, 0) |? = | v1, 0, #1) |? = 1. (20) 


The radiation from this state is thus unpolarized on scheme (A). If 
it were excited by (8), it would be completely polarized. Actually Skin- 
ner finds that the polarization is either absent or extremely weak. 

Another case of interest is that of *P:, which gives the resonance line. 
Here j’ = k’ = s'’ = 13m’ = 0, +1; | 


24 1 
(0/0) = f ip f sin ddd sin 3 cos(g + B) cos? = 0 (21) 


so that y(1, 0, 0) = 0. Further, (19) gives | 
| v1, 0, #1) |? = 4/2 (22) 


The polarization of the resonance line is thus of opposite sign and similar 
magnitude to that given by the momentum rules. That is what is found.’ 
By the same methods one finds for the *P2. terms: 


y(2, 0,0) = y(2,0, +2) = 0, | 
ene ieee aaa (23), 


For the 3D, and *D, states the excitation (A) is impossible. Lines from 
these states should, therefore, be weaker than the others, and their polari- 
zation should fall rather below that of the momentum rules. For *D, 
this has been reported by Skinner.? For the *D; the excitation (A) is 
possible; the states m = 0, +1 are all excited, but the polarization is only 
slightly less than that of the momentum rules. This is also confirmed. 

It may be mentioned that the transformation function y(j’, &,, m’) 
enables one to answer the question: Given that an atom has a certain 
energy in a weak magnetic field; what is the probability that it will have 
a given energy (Paschen-Back level) in a strong field? | 

In conclusion we may summarize the theoretical predictions on the 
polarization of impact radiation: For very high electronic velocities the 
line has, insofar as the excitation is direct (in principle this can be sepa-

rated from cascade effects), a polarization --p. As the velocity of the 
exciting electron is diminished, this polarization also diminishes, and 
changes sign at a voltage of the order of 200. ‘The polarization then 
increases with diminishing velocity, and the curve, if extrapolated to the 
resonance velocity, gives a polarization +). When the velocity of the 
electron approaches that of the resonance potential, the polarization 
grows more slowly, and has a maximum within a volt or so of the resonance 
potential; thereafter it approaches zero. ‘The polarization » may, for 
normal lines, and for intercombination lines for which the excitation 
(A) is impossible, be computed by the momentum rule; for other inter- 
combination lines it is more nearly given by the method (19) outlined 
above.

LHE RESIDUAL SET OF A COMPLEX ON A MANIFOLD AND

1. In a recent Note under the same title! I communicated two very 
general formulas concerning certain topological simultaneous invariants 
of a C, on an M,, true subset of the manifold (formulas (3), (4) of the 
Note). ‘The proofs were given explicitly and completely for a polyhedral 
Cy, i.e., a subcomplex of a subdivision of the C,, defining M,. Regarding 
the general C, it was stated on the strength of a certain theorem that the 
derivation of the formulas could proceed without change, and likewise for 
the most general closed subset G of /,,. On more searching examination 
it turned out to be decidedly otherwise, partly due to a necessary change 
in the theorem, and that the proofs for the polyhedral C;, would have to 
undergo profound change before they could carry over to the more general
