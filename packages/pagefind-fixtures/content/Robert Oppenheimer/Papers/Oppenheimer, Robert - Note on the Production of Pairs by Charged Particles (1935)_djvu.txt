Note on the Production of Pairs by Charged Particles 


J. R. OPPENHEIMER, Department of Physics, University of California 
(Received December 3, 1934) 


We compute the internal conversion by pair-production of the radiation emitted in the 
impact of charged particles. When the energy available for pair-production is large compared to 
mc?, this simple method gives a valid estimate of pair-production by the impact. For electrons of 
very high energy the probability of pair-production increases as [In (E./mc?) P. 


HE production of pairs by charged particles 
of high energy has been considered by 
Furry and Carlson,! and by Heitler and Nord- 
heim.? In both of these researches the probability 
of pair production is calculated by an application 
of the systematic Born-Mgller perturbation 
theory for relativistic impacts. We want here 
to consider a rather simpler method of treating 
the problem for the case that the energy available 
for pair production is very large compared to mc’. 
Consider first pair production by the impacts 
of a heavy charged particle on a nucleus, where 
we may take the velocity of the particle vc, 
and where, in order that large energies may be 
available for pair production, we shall suppose 
that pu®>mc, where w= M,M2/(M+M2) is the 
reduced mass of particle and nucleus. For this 
case the impact of the two heavy particles and 
the electromagnetic field produced by the impact 
can be computed purely classically, and we have 
to study the production of pairs by this field. 
For the components of this field of frequency 
p> vy=mc?/h, the wavelength is small compared 
to the region, of order #/mc, in which pair 
production is important, so that the radiation 
field of the impact may, despite vc, be supposed 
in this limit to contribute essentially to pair 
production. | 
It is easy to calculate the effect of this radia- 
tion field, if we neglect altogether the diffrac- 
tion zone field of the charges. To do this 
we may use the classical expression for the 
intensity of the continuous x-ray spectrum. If 
mass and charge of the two particles are Mi, Ze; 
M., Z2e, respectively, then for unit incident flux 
of impacting particles the intensity per unit

PAIR PRODUCTION BY CHARGED PARTICLES 


treating an impact with 2,2.>1, v<c, can 
hardly be established, it probably gives correct 
results for the special case of the Coulomb field. 
On the other hand, the fields calculated by 
Heitler and Nordheim are just the diffrac- 
tion zone fields which we have neglected; they, 
in turn, have neglected the radiation field 
entirely. The fact that for large ¥/vo, (4) is 
larger in order of magnitude than (5), may be re- 
garded as a justification for our neglect of the dif- 
fraction zone fields, and of the validity, for p> vp, 
of (4). For y~ v9, on the other hand, (4) and (5) 


give contributions of the same order of magni-_ 


tude, so that both fields must be considered. 
This same method can be applied to pair 
production by electrons of energy E>>mc*. Here 
we have again to limit ourselves to impacts in 
which the reaction of the pairs on the impacting 
electron can be neglected. This restriction, which 
is also involved in the calculations of Carlson 
and Furry, means that the energy of the pair

by these authors, and as follows also from our 
calculations, this restriction does not, for large 
FE, affect the order of magnitude of the results. 
The neglect of the diffraction zone parts of the 
field of the particles is here even less open to 
question than in the case of heavy charges. 

We have now, however, to use in place of (1) 
the expression for the continuous radiation from 
high energy electrons in a Coulomb field, for 
which Bethe and Heitler* give, for hvy<E,

The calculation of internal conversion, and of the radiation by heavy ions, will be unaffected by 
the screening of the nuclear field by atomic electrons. But as Bethe and Heitler* have shown, for 
E>me/aZ*, (6) must be modified. Instead we have, again for hv<E, 


I,= (327Z7e°/3m?c) In (199/Z*), (9) 


which leads to

Formulae (8) and (10) show that the probability of pair production by a very high energy electron 
differs from that for a gamma-ray of the same energy by a factor of the order alin (v/v) }?. This 
is in complete agreement with the conclusions of Furry and Carlson. For energies of 510° volts, 
(10) gives for the ratio of these probabilities about 10 percent. 


asymptotic value (7) for the internal conversion coefficient 
may be questioned. The true value of the internal conver- 
sion coefficient will be smaller than (7). This correction 
will not affect the dominant term of the result.
