On the Quantum Theory of Vibration-Rotation Bands. By 
J. R. OPPENHEIMER. (Communicated by Mr R. H. Fow er.) 


[Received 24 May, read 26 July, 1926.] 


1. The frequencies of the lines in the vibration-rotation 
spectrum of a diatomic molecule may be obtained unambiguously 
by the application of the classical quantum dynamics to a simple 
molecular model. The dominant term in the intensities of these 
lines has been obtained by Fowler* from the summation rules; this, 
and the next term, were computed by Kemblef from an application 
of the correspondence principle to a three-dimensional model. But 
the details of these calculations are not free from ambiguity. For, 
in the first case, the weight of the states, and, in the second, the 
method of averaging over transitions, is arbitrary. For the outer 
lines of the band this ambiguity is negligible; for the inner ones, 
and particularly for the missing central line, it is not. 

Now the new mechanics { gives a precise solution of this problem, 
and might accordingly be expected to decide definitely the in- 
tensity of the null line, and the value of the higher terms in the 
intensities of the outer lines. The purpose of this note is to obtain 
the solution, and to compare it with previous results, and with 
the results of experiment. 

The problem has been treated by Brillouin§. Brillouin’s chief 
conclusions are (1) that, contrary to the contention of Heisenberg ||, 
the new mechanics does not necessarily give the same energies as 
the classical theory with the introduction of half-integral quantum 
numbers; and (2) that, if Heisenberg’s result were correct, the new 
mechanics would account for the disappearance of the central line. 
He uses Cartesian coordinates (9,9), and their corresponding 
momenta (p,p,). He imposes the constraint

and the single quantum condition 


(1) [471] + [9272] = 2 
for the rotational motion, where [ab] is the Poisson Bracket of

conditions reduce, in this case, to a single condition

which cannot be reduced to the form (1). Moreover, in the Hamil- 
tonian used by Brillouin the coupling of the kinetic energies of 
rotation and vibration is neglected. Finally, the problem is treated 
in two dimensions, so that we should not expect t correct values 
for the intensities. Brillouin does not give his solution in detail. 
He does give the intensities for the case of vanishing coupling, and 
for this case gets the same intensities for all lines of a band. But 
it may readily be shown that the differential equation is regular, 
uniformly in the coupling parameter A as this tends to zero. It 
follows that the argument cannot explain the absence of the central 
line for the small finite values of A which occur. In fact we shall 
show that, in the two-dimensional case, the central line would be 
present. 


2. The dynamical problem. We may take for model two point- 
atoms attracting each other radially. If the masses of the atoms 
be m, and m,, then the classical Hamiltonian, after the elimination 
of the centre of gravity, becomes ,

Since we shall not ultimately want x,y, %, 22.42%, and since the elimi- 
nation of the centre of gravity (3) holds in the quantum theory, we 
may take (2) as Hamiltonian. There is as yet no adequate reason 
for not choosing some classically equivalent form. The only other 
result which we shall take over directly from the classical theory 
is the expression for the energy radiated per second. We shall use 
this in terms of Cartesian coordinates and accelerationst; and we 
shall not be inconsistent if we take the Hamiltonian in terms of 
them. 
In the classical solution it is convenient to use polar angle 
variables. These cannot be represented by matrices, and we shall

accordingly adopt the more general methods developed by Dirac*. 
We want a canonical transformation to uniformizing variables such 
that xyz shall be periodic in the angle variables. Classically we 
should obtain this by three successive transformations: introduc- 
tion of polar coordinates, in which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation 
separates; elimination of the nodes; and uniformization of the 
vibration-rotation. Diract has shown that there is a canonical 
transformation equivalent to the first two:

molecule can rotate uniformly; that this rotation is stable; and 
that the amplitude of the oscillations about it which do in fact 
occur is small compared with the mean distance of separation of 
the atoms. Then we must have 


Pr=[p-H]=90; f= [rH]=90; kyky= pr? (U' (7), py] 
when we substitute the proper quantum numbers for k, and the 
corresponding c-number for 7. We shall take over this c-formula, 
which may be justified physically, and write 


hk, _> _y 

(8) na® (by (UD, ]r-ate) = U' (a) (Def.), 

where & and a are g-numbers. Further, we set r= a (kK) + p, and 
thus obtain from (1) and (8), the expansion

The retention of first order terms in A does not affect the fre- 
quencies, but changes the intensities. It follows, however, from 
the form of the transformation for 7 and 8%, that the relative 
intensities of lines in the same band will be changed only by a 
factor of the order of k*J*/a'w!, which is small compared with the 
terms we shall retain, and too small for experimental detection. 
‘The new mechanics is, of course, applicable to the more general 
case; but the transformation, even in the simplest case, where 
U’” (a) ~ 0, is very cumbersome. We shall accordingly neglect 
and observe that our results will not give us the intensities in the 
overtone bands.

assume that these satisfy the quantum conditions, we get at once

[pp] = (K3] = — 1.

and 


Moreover 


(13) 2 + wp? = hw (2d + 2c Jet) = Qwdy. 
From the first of these (11) it follows that r and p, are canonical. 
From the second (12) we get, neglecting powers of ive above the

Assuming therefore that the new variables satisfy the quantum 
conditions, we have shown that the old variables satisfy all the 
quantum conditions. This establishes the transformation. The as- 
symmetry of r and p,, and thus of W, in J, is not peculiar to this 
problem. It has its analogue in the harmonic oscillator, for which

This differs from the classical value in having J, for J, and k,k, 
for k?. 

Before we can find the frequencies, we must decide how to 
assign the quantum numbers, n, m, 8, corresponding to the action 
variables J, k, p. The hypothesis of a normal state for the vibratory 
motion means that » must be integral. The argument by which 
m and s are determined is strictly analogous to that given by 
Dirac* and Born, Heisenberg, and Jordant for the Zeeman effect 
of an atom with one series electron. We should expect s to be so 
chosen that

that s may vary from — m + 4 to + m — }; it is readily seen from 
the values we get for the intensities (18), that all transitions from 
8 values within this range to those outside are forbidden. Finally, 
we may choose m to give a normal state for which a transition 
with decreasing m is impossible. In this case the only physical 
justification for such an assumption is the observed absence of the 
central line*. We shall show that the central line does not vanish 
if the only condition on m is Brillouin’s condition of symmetry for 
positive and negative rotations. 

With this assignment of quantum numbers (clearly s is ir- 
relevant) we get for the absorption frequencies

The difference between these and the classical frequencies is too 
small for experimental detection, more particularly since a (0) and 
w, can only be found from the band itself. The energy differences 
would, however, give an appreciable term in the specific heats. 


4. Intensities. We may now compute the a priort intensities of 
the band lines directly. For this we need z, y, z in terms of the final 
variables. In each case we have several alternative forms. Thus 


(15) 
z= 5 (mae + «~*m,) = $ (e?a, + «-*a,) r= 5 (ae + @e#*) .... 


But since all the transformations are canonical, these forms ought 
to give the same intensities; and it may be readily verified that 


they do. Now to the second order in a, We Bet, using the ex-

This in part resolves the paradox noted by Fowler. For the two 
branches are nearly equal in intensity in spite of the assymmetry 
of the temperature factor. The main part of the assymmetric 
factor which compensates this had been previously obtained by 
Kemble from the Coriolis forces. 

This means that the summation rules do not apply exactly, 
because the frequency differences of the lines of the band are not

Dirac for their criticism and advice.

5. Summary. The dynamical problem of the “diatomic mole- 
cule” is solved on the new mechanics. The terms of the rotational 
energy are A (m? — }), where m = + 4, $, §...; the weights of the 
corresponding states are 2m; the frequencies differ a little from 
the classical ones. Finally the intensities are slightly different from 
those computed by Kemble; the main term agrees with that of 
Fowler, but the positive branch is only slightly stronger than the 
negative. The central line vanishes. The intensities are valid only 
for the fundamental band. 


6. Addendum. This problem has been treated by Schrédinger* 
by his method of characteristics. Schrédinger does not find the 
intensities; but he obtains energy terms which give frequencies in 
agreement with (14) and (14a). More recently the problem has been 
treated by Mensingt by the method of matrices in a paper which 
came to hand just as the writing of this paper was completed. 
Mensing neglects y but retains 4. The main terms in the intensities 
of the fundamental band are, of course, the Zeeman factors of (18). 
By an application of Born and Jordan’s solution for the anharmonic 
oscillator { Mensing also obtains expressions for the intensities in 
the overtones. It is, however, readily seen from (17) that the terms 
arising from y are of the same order as those arising from A, and 
that, with the actual values of these constants for the hydrogen 
halides, the former terms predominate for the outer lines of the 
overtone bands. It is probably therefore not justified to neglect 
them and retain A.
