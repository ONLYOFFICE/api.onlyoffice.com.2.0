HE quantum theory of the electromagnetic field! gives a unitary treat- 

ment, on the one hand of the electrostatic fields, and, on the other, of the 
theory of radiation. The distinction between electrostatic and radiation fields 
may be preserved in the general theory; for it is possible to put, on this theory, 
the total energy of a system of field and charges in such a form, that the con- 
tributions from the two fields remain distinct. In this total energy there are, 
in addition to the kinetic energy of the charges, terms of three kinds: (a) the 
electrostatic interaction energy of the charges with each other and with them- 
selves; (b) the energy of the light quanta, to which must be added an infinite 
constant, corresponding to a half quantum of energy for each component of 
the radiation field; (c) the interaction energy of the charges and the radiation 
field, which gives the magnetic interaction of the charges, the infinite proper 
magnetic energy of the charges, and those interactions which give rise to the 
absorption, emission, and scattering of light quanta. 

The terms (b) and (c) are quite similar to those which appear in the 
relativistic extension? of Dirac’s light quantum theory. There are nevertheless 
points of difference between the two theories. Some of these differences are 
altogether trivial; but there are a few which are rather deep-lying. We may 
cite a few examples of this divergence: 

A. In the field theory, the electrostatic field is an integral and Hevitable 
part of the electromagnetic field; only when it is included can one establish 
the invariance of the scheme under space rotations and Lorentz transforma- 
tions; but in the Dirac theory there is apparently no place for an electrostatic 
field, and Lorentz covariance may be established without considering such a

field; on the other hand the behavior of the scheme under space rotations had 
not been investigated, and it has therefore not been possible to establish con- 
servation laws for angular momentum, nor to derive from them the selection 
rules. 

B. There is in the Dirac theory no analogue to the infinite zero point 
energy which, on the field theory, must be added to the energy of the quanta 
in the radiation field. On the other hand we should expect in a completely and 
consequently corpuscular theory of light to meet with negative energies for 
the quanta; there is apparently no analogue to these negative energies in the 
field theory. 

Of course all these points are not unconnected; it will be in part the pur- 
pose of this paper to study the connection between them, and to see which of 
the points of difference arise from an incompleteness of the present theory of 
quanta, and thus may be dissipated by extending the theory, and which are 
fundamental and persist. It will turn out that in all the points mentioned 
under A, the light quantum theory, when properly extended, is in full agree- 
ment with the field theory; but that in the points of difference B, there is an 
irresoluble disparity between the two theories. But before we may profitably 
make the comparison, we shall have on the one hand to develop a somewhat 
more complete light quantum theory than that of Dirac; and on the other 
to make minor formal changes in the Heisenberg-Pauli field theory. It will be 
easy then to answer the questions which we have put. 


2: 


We shall begin by developing an extreme light quantum theory, and for- 
get for the time all connection with Maxwell’s equations. We shall postpone 
too a treatment of the interaction of quanta and charges, for this treatment 
is most readily given after the connection between light quantum theory and 
quantum electrodynamics has been established. Our present problem is to 
find the wave equation for the de Broglie waves of the quantum; the theory 
of the field we shall then obtain by a suitable quantization of the de Broglie 
amplitudes. 

In obtaining the wave equation we may be helped by a consideration of 
the integrals of angular momentum for light quanta. There are in particular 
two selection rules for the absorption and emission of radiation by matter, 
which should follow from the conservation of angular momentum, and the 
properties of the quanta which appear or disappear. These rules apply strictly 
to angular momentum measured about a space fixed point, and only with high 
approximation (see Eq. (9) ) to that measured about the center of mass of a 
heavy atom. The rules assert: I. That the component of atomic angular mo- 
mentum parallel to the direction of motion of the quantum absorbed or 
emitted changes during the process by one Bohr unit; the sign of the change 
is determined by the polarization of the quantum; II. That the total angular 
momentum of the atom may not remain zero during the process of radiation. 

There is a third more qualitative rule, which asserts that the probability 
that on emission or absorption there be a change of more than one unit in 


LIGHT QUANTA 727 


total atomic angular momentum, that this probability is small when the wave 
length of the light A is large compared to the dimensions a of the atom, and of 
the order 

(a/d)”? 


for a change of atomic angular momentum of 1+6 units. To establish this rule 
one must know something more of the interaction of quanta and charges be- 
yond the validity of the conservation laws; we shall be able to derive it later. 

But these rules already tell us what we need to know: the component of 
angular momentum of a light quantum parallel to its direction of motion 
must be plus or minus one Bohr unit, according to the polarization of the 
quantum; the total angular momentum of a quantum about any point must 
be an integral number of Bohr units, and may not vanish. If these statements 
are true, the conservation laws will give us the selection rules. 

It should be observed of course that these rules refer to the eigenwerte of 
the angular momentum. There are many radiation processes in which the 
components of angular momentum of the atom are not determinate; but if we 
render them determinate, by the use, say of magnetic fields and circularly 
polarized light, then the rules will hold. We may also mention that the 
second and third rules, which refer to total angular momentum, could be de- 
rived classically, and that this is in fact historically the origin of the selection 
rules. But classically the first rule makes trouble; for a strictly plane electro- 
magnetic wave has no component of angular momentum parallel to its vector 
of propagation. Such a component can not arise from orbital angular momen- 
tum; one may, if one chooses, ascribe it to a spin of the quantum. But unlike 
the electronic spin, the spin of the quantum is a whole, not a half unit; yet it 
has two, and not three-eigenwerte; zero is not an eigenwert. Further, the total 
angular momentum of a quantum may not vanish; spin and unit orbital angu- 
lar momentum may not be antiparallel. These are the facts which must guide 
us. 

Now the second order relativistic equation which we should try first for 
our wave equation is the equation of the retarded potentials, which might 
serve for a particle free of forces and of vanishing mass

This equation is in several respects unsatisfactory. Here, just as for the elec- 
tron, we should want a linear equation, in order to obtain a suitable density- 
flux vector with vanishing divergence. We want, too, more than one kind of 
quantum for given vector of propagation, since we must describe somehow 
the polarization of the quantum. Also the integrals of angular momentum 
come out wrong. The corresponding operator is 


L = (h/2ri)[r X VI]. 


The eigenwerte of the component Ak/27 parallel to the vector of propagation 
are zero; and the eigenwerte of the total angular momentum /, with

Now some years ago Jordan suggested that we take account of the polar- 
ization of light quanta by using® Pauli’s spin matrices 6. With their help we 
can factor (1), and obtain the two component equation 


{(6-v) + aby = 0. 


Here ¥ no longer behaves as an invariant under space rotations, but as a 
spinor of the first rank. We know, however, that it will be impossible to 
associate such a spinor with any electromagnetic field strength or potential; 
for the whole of classical electromagnetics involves vectors only. Here the 
angular momentum operator is 


L = (h/2nri)[r & V] + =< 


and gives for the eigenwerte

This suggests that we should try a three component theory. We introduce 
a new 


Y = (1, We, Ws) 


and in place of the 6; three three-row matrices 7; which are the components 
of a vector 


= (71, TQ) 73). 
We let the 7; satisfy the commutation laws 
[o X «| = ie (3) 


so that they have the eigenwerte 0, +1. We shall have occasion to introduce 
explicit matrices for the 7; later. We write now for our wave equation 


{(e-v) + aty =0. (4) 
The properties of the solutions of this equation are easy to study. The 
density—flux vector has the components 
W; obra 


and on the basis of (4) its divergence vanishes. Thus cr plays in some respects 
the part of the velocity; the eigenwerte of the components are 0, +c. Further 
the energy and momentum are given by 


E = (he/2at)d; p = (hf 
3 P. Jordan, Zeits. f. Physik, 44, 292 (1927). 


LIGHT QUANTA 729 


so that (4) is just 
E = (p-v). (5) 


As in Dirac’s equation for the electron, velocity and momentum may have 
opposite sense, and the energy may be negative. To each value of the mo- 
menta, there correspond three solutions of (5), with the eigenwerte 


H=0, + pe. 
If we look for monochromatic solutions of (4), setting 
ST aaa Re 7 ial a7 
we find 
(c-V)u = iwi. (6) 
From this we deduce 
wlA + w?]u = 0. (6a) 


Thus any w constant in time is a solution of (4). Solutions which vary in time 
must satisfy (1). , 

We may learn more of these solutions by considering a special case. We 
look for solutions in the form of a plane wave, so that they depend upon the 
coordinates only through the common factor 


erkez 


We may then take 73 diagonal, and obtain the three solutions of (6) 


w = ke; uy, = 6: wo = 0; 43 = 0; 
QO = 0; uy = 0; un >= Oe us = 0; (6b) 
w= — ke; uv, = 0; Uy = 0; Uz = erhe. 


Now with this choice of 73, the u; transform under a three-dimensional rota- 
tion like the components of a spinor of the second rank 


Uy ~~ QW 'M%eiB(y + ty) 
Uy ™ — B 


. hg ~~ QM 2%e- Ble — ty). 


The solution with w =0 thus has the vector U of which the w’s are the “spinor 
components” parallel to the vector of propagation; whereas for w+0, this 
vector lies in a plane perpendicular to the vector of propagation. This sug- 
gests that the solutions with w=0 will turn out to have something to do with 
the static solutions of Maxwell’s equations, and that the solutions with 
w+ 0 will be connected with the light quantum solutions. 

Note on notation. We shall have, in the following to distinguish between 
three and four vectors, and their spinor components. In general we shall use 


730 J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


capitals for the vector, small letters for the spinor, components; further we 
shall use latin indices for three-greek indices for four-vectors and spinors, and 
shall use a raised index for contragredience, and adopt the summation con- 
vention. Since we shall not use the spinor components in four dimensions, but 
rather components which are half spinor and half vector, we give here a table 
of the notation and components: 
Thus

Finally, we shall use 0; for the spinor components of the gradient Vi. 

We may define the angular momentum operator by considering an 
infinitesmal rotation of coordinates. Thus, if we make such a rotation 6; 
about the z-axis, and if the corresponding change in the u’s is du, then the z- 
component of the angular momentum L, is given by 


bu = (2ri/h)Lub, = |x(0/0%) — y(0/dx) + irs |udy. 


So we find 
L = (h/2mri)|r X ¥] + (h/20)t. (7) 


The Eq. (6) is invariant under a space rotation, and the components of L 
are constants of the motion of the quantum. In particular, for plane wave 
solutions, the component of L parallel to the vector of propagation commutes 
with the momentum, and has the eigenwerte 


wo =0; }=0 
w—0; X= +1. 


The total angular momentum defined by (2) also commutes with the energy, 


and has the eigenwerte 
ee | ap ee ee 


The value 0, cannot, however, occur except wien w=0. For if 7=0, then 
c= -ilrXyl. 
If we put this in (6), we get at once 
wu = — (Ir X V]-V)u = 0. 


Thus we see that (6) gives to true light quanta, with w+0 the correct inte- 
grals of angular momentum. From these, and the conservation laws we may 
deduce the selection rules I and II. 


LIGHT QUANTA 731° 


Now to each vector of propagation there are, as we have seen, three 
solutions of (6); but if we fix the energy, choosing it for instance positive, 
only one solution survives; we get only one possible value for A, and thus only 
one kind of polarization. If we wish to exclude negative energies, then (6) 
will not give us all the solutions we need, and we shall have to add another 
set, the solutions of an equation analogous to (4), but with matrices 7’ which 
satisfy, instead of (3) 


[e’ xX o/] = — ae’, (3’) 
Then we write 
[(e’ A) + 0: |p’ = 0. (4’) 
The angular momentum is now 
L! = h/2nilr X V] — h/2re. (7’) 


To each k and w#0, we now have two solutions of (4) and 4’), withh=+1 
respectively. We can of course write the two systems (4) and (4’) as one, if we 
use a six component wave function, and reduced six row matrices, which 
have the 7’s and the 7’’s along the main diagonal. In this system of equations 
we can exclude by an auxiliary condition the solutions for which the energy 
is negative. We have only to use the improper operator »/A which was intro- 
duced by Landau and Peierls, and to write 


Ow =e, ae V/ AW. 


But when we come to introduce the interaction energy of quanta and charges, 
this condition will no longer be consistent with the equations of motion for 
the y’s, since we shall always have terms in this interaction which give rise to 
a spontaneous emission of quanta of negative energy. It is not possible in 
this theory to exclude quanta of negative energy. 

It will be convenient for us later to have the solutions of (6) which make / 
and L,=m, say, diagonal; these may be obtained in polar coordinates, with 
the polar axis parallel to z. For w<0, /40, we get two such solutions, with

of cos 9, the J’s may be given in terms of Bessel’s functions by

and the c’s are constants which do not in general vanish, and which take on 
different values according to whether w= +c. For the choice of the matrices 
7; given in (10), the c’s may be taken real, and to satisfy

732 J. -R. OPPENHEIMER 


For 1/=0, w =0, and for |e | =], the first term on the right side of (8) does not 
appear. 

We may use (8) to derive the third of our selection rules. We shall show in 
the next sections that the probability of the emission or absorption by an 
atom of a quantum in a state 7 is given essentially by the square of the modu- 


lus of the integral 
B= i dV u,"s' 


where the vector S is the current density vector of the atom. Now when the 
wave-length 27/k of the quantum is large compared to the dimensions a of 
the region in which S is appreciable, we may expand the functions J in the 
integral B about the center of mass of the atom, taken as origin, and station- 
ary. Thus we find that if /,=1-+6, B is small of the order 


(ak)?. 


This makes the probability of absorption or emission of a quantum with 


1/=1-+6, small of the order 
(ak)? 


and gives, in conjunction with the conservation laws for angular momentum, 
the third of our selection rules. By a similar argument we may take account 
of the recoil of the atom as a whole upon absorption or emission. This recoil 
will be small when the atom is massive compared to the quantum; it gives rise 
to a probability for a violation of the selection rules for angular momentum 
measured about the center of mass of the atom. This probability is of the 


order 
(hk/ Mc)? (9) 


where M is the mass of the atom. For ordinary light this probability is ex- 
tremely small. 

Although, as we have seen, our fundamental Eq. (4) is covariant under a 
space rotation, it is not Lorentz covariant. From (6a) and (6b), we see that 
the reason for this noncovariance is the occurrence of zero eigenwerte for the 
7’s and for w. This suggests at once that (4) is a degenerate form of a set of 
four simultaneous equations for four W’s, involving three four-row matrices 
ps, of which the 7; are certain three-row submatrices; and that these four row 
matrices p; must have the eigenwerte +1, each twice. A simple investigation 
of the behavior of (4) under a Lorentz transformation will make this clear. 

Let us take for definiteness our 7; in the form

sional rotation 


Wi ~ 212% + 1y) 
Y2~ — 2 
v3 2712(x% — iy). 


Now consider a Lorentz rotation in the z—¢ plane. We should expect V2 to 
transform like the g-component of a covariant four-vector; let us call the 
t-component of this vector V,. Then we see that in the transformed Eq. (4), 
new terms appear which give just the four-divergence of VY. This suggests 
that we should so extend our matrices 7; that the fourth row and column refer 
to V4, and that the fourth equation makes the four divergence of VY vanish. 
Thus we may take

This gives us p;2=1. The p; each have the eigenwerte +1, each twice; they 
no longer satisfy (3). 


The system 
{(e-v) + ay = 0 (12) 


is now Lorentz invariant. Our Eq. (4) 


{(r-v) + aby =0 


follows from (12) if we set 
4 = 0. (13) 
But we obtain from (12) the further condition 
OY; = Vii = 0. (14) 


The three divergence of the three vector YW must vanish. This condition 
makes the solutions of (4) for which w=0, reduce to constants. Here again 
we see the connection between these solutions and those solutions of Maxwell’s 
equations which give the electrostatic field: in the absence of charges there 
may be no such field. 


734 J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


The equations (4) and (14) are themselves Lorentz covariant, if we trans- 
form the y’s, not as the spatial components of a four-vector, but as the 4—k 
components of a self dual six vector. This six vector V,, may be completely 
determined by giving its 4— components in terms of the y’s: 


Va = i/212p, +3); V2 = 1/2120, — ws); Wag = — ie; Wa, = Oz 
We can of course use a similar procedure for making (4’) Lorentz covariant. 

These equations may all be written very simply in spinor notation. For 
(12) we get : 
Ow = 0 (12’) 
while for the system (4) and (14) we have 


Oyt = 0. (12”) 


For the system corresponding to (4’) then 


Ow? = 0. (127”) 
These last two systems have the same form as Maxwell’s equations for the 
empty field.2> We should therefore expect to have to add on the right hand 
side of these systems essentially the four-vector charge and current density of 
matter; we should then have the correct interaction between quanta and 
charges. The precise form of these terms will be given in section 3. 

This spinorial form for the wave equations lets us see at once a very grave 
and inescapable defect of the theory. The equations themselves are co- 
variant; but the Lagrangian from which they and their complex conjugate 
equations may be deduced is not a scalar density. This has important and 
disastrous consequences, for it means that the energy density of the quanta 
is not the 4-4 component of a second rank tensor, nor the momentum density 
the 4-k component of such a tensor. Further, and equally disastrous, the 
density and flux of the quanta do not form a four-vector, so that these quan- 
tities may surely be given no simple physical meaning. All of these results 
follow at once from the circumstance that one cannot construct an in- 
variant which shall be linear in P 

Anyi 
and linear in the complex conjugates of the y’s:

nor make a four vector bilinear in ¥"' and y’™. This is impossible both for the 
system (12’) and the systems (12’’); and we can see at once that it will be 
impossible for any system in which the y’s are spinors of even rank—i.e. 
world vectors and tensors. If we wish to have a positive definite particle 
density of the form 


Vis

LIGHT QUANTA 735 


which shall be the four component of a four vector, then our wave functions 
must necessarily be spinors of odd rank. This is the essential ground for the 
impossibility of a completely satisfactory light quantum theory. 

The fact that the energy density of the light quanta cannot be written ina 
proper form means that the conservation laws for a system of quanta and 
charges cannot be made covariant. We shall see another expression of this 
difficulty when we try to write down the interaction energy of the quanta 
and charges. And this difficulty will persist as long as we want to write our 
energy density in the form 7 

Yow. 

If we give up this condition, which is essential to a truly corpuscular theory, 
we see at once that 

prapim 
gives us a satisfactory energy momentum tensor; this leads then to a system 
completely equivalent to classical electrodynamics, and the equations (12’’) 
become then just Maxwell’s equations for the empty field. By a suitable 
quantization the classical theory may of course be made to give a theory of 
the light quantum field. But as already pointed out by Landau and Peierls, 
it is then no longer possible to define a positive definite light quantum density, 
nor to treat the quanta as particles. 

‘As long then as we are concerned only with the empty field, our equations 
will be satisfactory. We have only in some coordinate system to set up (4), 
and to retain those solutions for which w does not vanish. This procedure will 
be Lorentz’ invariant, and will give the correct eigenwerete for the dynamical 
integrals of the quanta. We cannot however extend our theory without great 
arbitrariness to the case where charges are present, and interact with the 
quanta. To do this we have first to study the connection between our wave 
functions VY on the one hand, and the electromagnetic potentials and their 
treatment in the quantum mechanics on the other. It is this inability to find 
without the help of classical electromagnetics the correct form for the inter- 
action between quanta and charges that makes us believe that the light quan- 
tum theory is not in the end very fundamental, and that the analogy between 
light quanta and electrons, however attractive from the formal point of view, 
is not very deep lying. But before we pass to the electrodynamical theory, we 
may say a few words of this analogy. 

If we wish to make the transition from the theory of a single quantum to 
the theory of a field, in which many quanta satisfy the Einstein-Bose sta- 
tistics, we have only to write down the: errect commutation laws for the wave 
amplitudes V,. 


[y(P), W(P’)]=(h/27i)6,.5(P — P); [v.(P)wW.(P)] = [v.(P), ¥.(P)] = 0. 


The theory of such a system is very simple, and very closely analogous to the 
field theory for Dirac electrons. The Lagrangian is 


L = — (hi/2ri{(o+V) + d:}y. (16) 


736 J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


Setting Y,=0 gives us the supplementary condition (14). and the new Lag- 
rangian | 

L = — (he/2rib{(2-V) + a: hy. (16a) 
We may list here some of the principal operators 2 which gives us the dy- 


namical integrals of the field, together with the eigenwerte which we find for 
the integrals of these densities: Q = [d VyQy

It should be observed that the energy may be positive or negative, and that 
there is no zero point energy. 


Now we shall see in our next section that it is possible, by a somewhat 
different choice of Lagrangian, to pass from this extreme light quantum 
theory to quantum electrodynamics, in which the energy in the field is al- 
ways necessarily positive. We might now ask the question: Is it possible to 
find a similar trick for the theory of the Dirac electron, so that, perhaps at 
the expense of an infinite zero point energy, there would be only positive 
electronic energy levels? It turns out that we can find such a trick, rather 
simply, and we shall do so in our next section. (See Eqs. (37) and (38).) In 
this treatment a group of noninteracting electrons has only positive energy 
levels. If, nevertheless, we do not believe that any method of this kind will 
be of fruitful application, it is because of two major difficulties which appear. 
The one difficulty is this: if we apply the method to the study of a single elec- 
tron in a field of force, we find that the dynamical problem is always de- 
generate: for each energy there are wave functions which we should asso- 
ciate with the motion of particles of positive and negative charge-mass ratio 
e/m respectively. Radiative transitions between the corresponding states no 
longer occur; but we find energies and wave functions which are not found in 
experience; and in particular Klein’s paradox, the abnormal transparency of 
high potential barriers to slow electrons, still persists. The other fundamental 
difficulty is that with this method, using the new Lagrangian (38), it is not 
possible to make the electrons satisfy the exclusion principle. For these rea- 
sons we cannot regard this attempt to resolve the difficulty of negative elec- 
tronic energies as satisfactory. We shall not exploit further the analogy be- 
tween quanta and electrons.

We turn now to the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field. The 
Lagrangian function for the empty field is 


Lo = 1/80(E? — H®) = 1/16r[Vabs — VePal?. (17) 


LIGHT QUANTA 737 


Here E and H are theelectric and magnetic field strengths, and ® the four- 
vector potential. When charges are present we must add to (17) the term 


L; = S*6, (18) 


where SS is the four-vector charge and current density. By a variation of the 
®’s we may deduce Maxwell’s equations; by a variation of the S,, we may, 
after the addition of suitable inertial terms, deduce the equations of motion 
of the charges. 

If, asin HPIT, we simplify the analysis by setting 


b,=0 | (19) 

then the four Maxwell equation 
div E + 4rp = 0 (20) 
no longer follows from a variation of the ®,’s in L; we have to add (20) asa 
supplementary condition on our wave functions, in addition to those which 


now follow from the variation principle: i.e. our wave functions, F say, must 
fulfill 


{div E+ 4xp}F = 0. (20a) 
The momenta canonically conjugate to the ®; are 
1 
ey Se (21) 
4c’ 


We thus have the commutation laws 


[1(P), ¥i(P)] = (h/2ri)5:5(P — P’); [UCP), U(P’)] 


= [&(P), $;(P’)] = 0. (21a) 
The Hamiltonian is 
Hy = [ av{ dV \2ncll,? + 1/8r[v x &]? --f dVS,®p. (22) 
The components of momentum are 
jee f dVIsArds. (23) 


We shall see later the consequences of this disparity in form of the operators 
for energy and momentum; for the present it will be enough to remember that 
in spite of this, and in spite of the convention (19), the scheme is Lorentz 
invariant, in the sense that the equations fulfilled by all gauge invariant 
quantities, such as the field strength and energy, are covariant under a 
Lorentz transformation. The equations for the ®’s themselves are not co- 
variant; but one may, after a Lorentz transformation, return to the original 
equations by a new choice of gauge (Umeichung). 


738 J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


In nearly all the applications of the theory, it is convenient to introduce 
normal coordinates for the empty field, and to take the amplitudes of the 
corresponding oscillations as dynamical variables to replace the ®’s. This may 
be done in a number of ways. Thus in HPJ and HPII, potentials and field 
strengths are expanded in trigonometric functions of the coordinates, in such 
away that the tangential component of H and the normal component of & 
vanish at the boundary of a fundamental cube of dimensions LZ, which is 
chosen large compared to the region in which there are charges. This is equiva- 
lent to enclosing the system in a large box with perfectly reflecting walls; and 
the orthogonal functions represent plane polarized standing electromagnetic 
waves. Now there are many problems in which it is convenient to have the 
electromagnetic waves correspond to definite values, say, of the momentum 
or the angular momentum. For such a treatment one has to use new boundary 
conditions, and new orthogonal functions. When we carry through the neces- 
sary analysis, we shall be able to see very clearly the points of analogy and 
the points of disparity between the field theory and the light quantum theory; 
and this, rather than the convenience of the new schemes in application, is 
the reason why we shall give in some detail the elaboration of methods sub- 
stantially equivalent to those already in use. 

There are three cases which we shall consider; of these the first may be 
regarded as more or less preliminary; the orthogonal functions are to repre- 
sent: (a) plane polarized progressive waves of definite momentum; (b) circu- 
larly polarized progressive waves; (c) spherical waves of definite angular 
momentum. The boundary conditions for these three cases are pretty obvious. 
In order to have only an enumerable set of oscillations, we shall still con- 
sider a finite but large volume V. In (a) and (b) we may take this to be a cube 
of length L, and may require that potentials and field strengths be periodic 
in this cube. As long as the dimensions of the cube are very large compared to 
those of the region to which the charges are confined, we may neglect the 
image fields of the charges in neighboring cubes, and our formulae will give 
us results which may be readily interpreted. For (c) we must take our funda- 
mental volume spherical, and may for convenience demand that the poten- 
tials vanish on the surface of the sphere. It is in all cases quite easy to see 
which properties of the field are affected by the boundary conditions, and 
which are independent of them.

which involve the factor e*”. For each kind of polarization there is a term 
which gives the absorption of a quantum of momentum kh/27, and one which 
gives the emission of a quantum of momentum —kh/2r. 

There is a zero point energy, but no zero point momentum. We see 
formally that this difference arises from the circumstance that the J; are 
linear, but Ho is quadratic, in 0/0x,. It is this same circumstance that gives us 
both positive and negative momenta, but only positive energies. If we were 
to give up the condition that potentials and field strengths were necessarily 
real, then the energy would no longer be positive definite; in addition to (25), 
we should also have solutions of the form 


gu = — Qn; pw = — Pua; (25a) 
and our energy would have positive and negative eigenwerte 
Ext = hv Nia — Na+ New — N'oxa}. (29a) 


There would be no zero point energy; but in such a system there would be 
spontaneous gain in energy by atoms at the expense of the field, as well as 
spontaneous emission. The light quantum theory gives a situation very much 
like this. 

The interaction terms (31) are precisely those obtained by a direct rela- 
tivistic expansion of Dirac’s light quantum theory; they are the most con- 
venient form for the study of the emission, absorption and scattering of hard 
light.

for orthogonal functions the solutions of (6) in polar coordinates which vanish 
on the surface of a large sphere. We have given such solutions in (8); we 
normalize their phase by choosing the c’s real. Here again the solutions with

Although in both the field theory and the light quantum theory we have 
had occasion to use the equations 


(cV)u = wu; (sv) + db = 0; 


there are, even for the empty electromagnetic field, fundamental differences 
between the two theories. These may be summarized by comparing the 
Lagrangian functions of the two theories 


LQ: — (he/2ni) o[(e-¥) + d:]¢ (36a) 


Field: (1/8) {| ab| 2 —| (e-w)o|?}. (36b) 


This difference brings with it disparate definitions of the conjugate momenta 


LQ: wm; = — (h/2ri)g; 


Field: | ry = — (1/42) (0:¢:) 
and of the Hamiltonian 


LQ: (hc/2ri)o(2-V)o = cr'(e: Vd; 


Field: (1/84) { | | 2+] (e-W)o| 2} = 2mcPatns + (1/87) | (e- Vo]? 


and accounts for the occurrence, in the one case of negative, in the other of 
infinite positive energies. | 

The nonoccurrence of a zero point energy in the light quantum theory is 
of interest in connection with an investigation® of Heisenberg on the electro- 
magnetic mass of charges moving with a velocity close to that of light. One 
must require of a correct electrodynamics that it should give, for the electro- 
magnetic energy-momentum vector of such a charge, a four vector the length 
of which grows, in comparison with the magnitude of the time component, 
the energy, negligible as the velocity approaches that of light. Now Heisen- 
berg showed, that with the HP field theory, the vector did not have these 
properties, and that the reason for this failure lay in the infinite zero point 
of the field. In this respect the light quantum theory is more satisfactory. 
But as we shall see in the next section, when we come to consider the inter- 
action of quanta and charges, the light quantum theory gives not only to the 
magnetic proper energy, but also to the magnetic interaction energy of 
charges, a value radically different from that obtained on the field theory, and 
one hardly to be reconciled with experiment. 

For the treatment of the Dirac electron outlined at the end of the last 
section, one has only to make in the Tetrode Lagrangian for the electron 


(hi/2ri)p[d, — (a:¥) + iyoo |p (y = 2xmc/h) (37)

a change analogous to that from (36a) to (36b) 
| aw]? —| [Ca-v) + tyao]y | 2. | (38) 


Here one has no condition on the reality of the ’s , and one obtains two com- 
plete systems of terms, corresponding to (25) and (25a) respectively. In each 
system the motion of a particle with positive and with negative charge-mass 
ratio e/m is represented. The particles necessarily satisfy the Einstein-Bose 
statistics. 

The interaction energies of field and charges given in this section have 
all been derived from the electrokinetic term 


S*by (18) 


in the Lagrangian. We have now to find what terms must be added to the 
Lagrangian of the light quantum theory, to give correctly the electrostatic 
energy of the field, and the elementary probabilities for radiative processes.

When we develop the field theory by the methods of the last section, the 
interaction terms (18) of the Lagrangian appear finally in two ways, and 
give rise to the electrostatic energy and the energy of interaction of light 
quanta and charges. When we set Y,=0, the supplementary condition on the 
wave function involves p: 


div E+ 4rp = 0. | (20) 


With the help of this condition, the terms in the Hamiltonian which arise 
from those expansion terms of 


(1/80) E? = (2Qrc*)r? 


for which the orthogonal functions correspond to w=0, may be evaluated; 
they give the electrostatic energy of the field. The terms in 


SP; 


which appears directly in the Hamiltonian, may be divided into two groups. 
The one group, for which the expansion functions correspond to w=0, may 
be shown, as a consequence of (20), to contribute nothing to the energy. The 
other group, for which the expansion functions correspond to w0, gives the 
interaction energy of light quanta and charges, and may always be put in. 
the form 


i(he?/ | w |)? S°(Ng12D 0, — Te! N1/2u,). 


Here the uw, are a complete set of orthogonal functions (e.g. solutions of (6)). 
Now we may try to introduce into the Lagrangian of the light quantum 
theory | 


L = — (he/2ni)o[(9-V) + a:]6 


LIGHT QUANTA 745 


interaction terms which will give these same results. These terms must (1) 
have real eigenwerte; (2) be Lorentz invariant; (3) be linear in S, and not in- 
volve the derivatives of S, nor any other quantities referring to the configura- 
tion of the charges; (4) be linear in @ and ¢. These conditions very nearly de- 
termine the form of the terms. The condition (4) shows that we cannot hope 
to find for the interaction of charges and quanta a form like that given by 
the Hamiltonian theory in configuration space for the interaction of two 
charges. 

The conditions give for the most general possible form for the interaction 
terms 


Stab, + Stady (39) 


where a is some operator not involving the field quantities. It is possible to 
find a formally satisfactory a; but one has to choose a very quaint operator 
indeed. The theory is satisfactory in the sense that it leads to the value (28) 
for the electrostatic energy, and gives the same values as the field theory for 
the probability of absorption or emission of quanta. This last assertion has 
of course to be modified, because of the occurrence of auanta of negative en- 
ergy, for which their is no analogue in the field theory. | 

This occurrence of quanta of negative energy has an important conse- 
quence, in that it alters the value of the magnetic interaction energy of 
charges. The calculation is altogether analogous to the field theory calcula- 
tion,® except that now half the quanta emitted or absorbed have negative 
energies; and the effect of these processes gives a contribution to the energy 
of opposite sign to that of the processes involving positive puanta. As a con- 
sequence, one can no longer deduce Breit’s equation for the second order 
magnetic energy;’ in fact the terms of second order in v/c vanish. This is of 
course in flagrant contradiction with experiment. 

The operator a has to be chosen, to obtain the best agreement with the 
field theory, in the form 

cw = etil4( fc) PE, 


Here é is an operator defined by the relations 
£ = Op 1/2. £29, = Of? = 1; &- [ soe ta = gtil4e1/2 | fedartte de; 


This choice of a gives at once light quantum interaction terms 


sig,’ ne i(he)*/2 doo, 2 (sia, Nery, os sti; Ty!)

of the desired form. Here again the terms from s‘g; for w =0 give no contribu- 
tion to the energy. The supplementary condition introduce by setting ~4=0 
here becomes 


El div 6 = 2r(he)2e-TI4p; po div 6 = 2r(hi)—eT*/4- p,

as required. | 

Against this formulation one may urge the gravest objections. Not only 
is the form of the interaction energy derived entirely with the help of elec- 
tromagnetic theory; this form itself is unsatisfactory because of the occur- 
rence of the improper operator £. Attempts to avoid the introduction of & lead 
at once away from the corpuscular theory to an alternative formulation of 
the field theory in terms of the complex vector £+7H. But to these formal 
objections to the theory of light quanta one must add that the occurrence of 
negative energies is in complete discord with experience, both in its direct 
consequences, which would give an apparent spontaneous absorption of light 
by matter, and in the value which it gives for the magnetic interaction energy 
of charges. And we must recall too the difficulties which arose in section 2, 
where we found it impossible to construct a scalar Lagrangian, a four vector 
density and flux, or an energy momentum tensor for the light quantum field. 
For all these reasons the theory developed in this paper is unsatisfactory. 
It is not impossible that when the occurrence of negative energies for elec- 
trons is fully understood, the theory of light quanta will be applicable.
