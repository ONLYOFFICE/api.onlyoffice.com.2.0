unified, however, by rotating the container of the suspension 
within the magnetic field around an axis parallel to the d1- 
rection of the (OO01 | axis which one wishes to obtain for the 
suspension.* It is obvious that by a turn around 90° the 
particles whose (0001) planes have not been parallel to 
the field will be acted upon by a ponderomotoric force, 
correcting for this deviation. This effect is amplified greatly 
_by bringing the particles gradually into an inhomogeneous 
region of the magnet. It is thus possible to line up all 
particles in both directions in a few minutes. Only then 
the suspending medium is hardened. The microphotographs 
Figs. 1 and 2 show such hardened gelatine suspensions of 
large graphite flakes, obtained without and with rotation 
and seen in the direction of the lines of force.

Referring to the remark of Professor Krishnan about the 
‘‘more or less uniform’’ size of the particles, it may be 
mentioned that greatest care was taken by fractionated 
sedimentation and centrifugation to have the variation of 
sizes of the particles not larger than 5 percent.®

contribution I wish to give him full credit.

The factor preceding the integral in Eq. (2) should read 
a/3ary® instead of a/ry’. 

In the second column in the tenth line of the first para- 
graph the expected yield of positives should be about 


6x<10-8 instead of 6X10 per alpha-particle.
