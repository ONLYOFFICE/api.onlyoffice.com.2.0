The IBM Electronic Data 
Processing Machines can serve 
as a needed substitute for ex- 
periment in certain scientific 
areas, Dr. J. Robert Oppen- 
heimer, Director of the Institute 
for Advanced Study at Princeton, 
N. J., told 200 leading scientists and 
leaders in education, government, 
defense and business who attended 
a luncheon April 7 at IBM World 
Headquarters and the first public 
showing of the new highspeed cal- 
culator. IBM Chairman Thos. J. 
Watson, who presided, presented 
IBM > President Thomas J. Watson 
Jr. and Dr. C. C. Hurd, Director of 
the IBM Applied Science Division, 
who later demonstrated the new ma- 
chines in the calculator room. 

Texts of the addresses of Messrs. 
Watson and Dr. Hurd appear else- 
where in this issue. 


Mr. Watson said that introducing 
Dr. Oppenheimer to the scientists 
and educators would be like intro- 
ducing the President of the United 
States to the Congress. 


“You are all familiar with Dr. 
Oppenheimer’s brilliant career,” he 
continued, “his important participa- 
tion in the atom bomb project, his 
able direction of the work of the 
Institute for Advanced Study, and 
his great record of service to his 
country, so that my pleasant duty 
in presenting him :o you today is 
un easy one. 


Cites Aid to Science 


“There is one phase of his car- 
cer, however, with which some of 
you may not be familiar, and in 
which I feel he has made a tre- 
mendous contribution to the achieve- 
ments of science. When he joined 
the faculties of the University of 
California and the California Insti- 
tute of Technology in the thirties, 
he surrounded himself with a group 
of young, full-time graduates who 
developed themselves into outstand- 
ing physicists under his guidance. 

“When war came and the need 
for nuclear physicists became ap- 
purent, this group of young men be- 
came an important nucleus around 
which was built the scientific team 
which contributed so greatly to the 
war effort. The work of these men, 
and of those who felt their influence, 
constitutes a self-perpetuating con- 
tribut.2n on the part of Dr. Oppen- 
heimer to the advancement of 
Pe: and to the progress of 


our world. 


“Ladies and gentlemen, I am 
honored to present to you Dr. J. 
Robert Oppenheimer, Director of 
the Institute for Advanced Study.” 

Dr. Oppenheimer spoke as fol- 
lows: 


“It is a pleasure to be associated in 
any way with this celebration; that 
is what we are here for today, to 
celebrate an extraordinary achieve- 
ment. I need hardly speak of the 
magnanimity, in the true sense of 
the word, of Mr. Watson, that has 
made this achievement possible. I 
think I should give a word of real 
congratulation to the scientists and 
engineers who have brought a com- 
puter into existence which, as it 
comes into existence, is neither too 
little nor too late. This is a quite 
rare Occurrence among computers. 


“When I was asked to talk, I had 
the impression that the ‘phone had 
rung in the wrong office at the Insti- 
tute, and I said, ‘Haven't you got 
the wrong number? Don’t you want 
to talk to Dr. von Neumann down 
the hall?” ‘No,’ I was told, ‘He 
really knows too much about this 
subject.” 

“So it was clear to me my task was 
limited. I am to talk about the 
meaning of the computers in re- 
search, in new understanding of the 
world; I am not to talk about the 
immense prospect of their contribu- 
tions to the defense program, of 
their contributions to industry, of 
their contributions to the solution of 
practical problems. 


Tells of Ancient Computation 


“The two are not too far apart. 
More than two millenia ago, com- 
pution was playing a very remark- 
able part in the life of Babylonia. 
There had been developed a most 
sophisticated and refined mathe- 
matical treatment of the raw data on 
lunar eclipses: purely as a mathe- 
matical problem without any  me- 
chanical model; without anything 
that we could call celestial mechan- 
ics. The problem the chaps had was 
to predict the next lunar eclipse and 
the next one after that, into the fu- 
ture. They learned the art of num- 
bers so well that these same methods 
were still in successful use in India 
in the last century; and this, remem- 
ber, was without any notion of the 
laws of motion; it was just from a 
study of the numbers themselves. 

“But the analogy goes further, be- 
cause they were not only interested 
in this because of the obvious prac- 
tical value, to a society in which 


Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer Praises Scientific Uses of ‘701 


eclipses hau some magic meaning, 
of knowing when they were going to 
occur, an ability to predict, so to 
speak, the local stock market; but 
the computations were also clearly 
followed simply because of the beau- 
ty of the occupation, because of the 
art and wonder of it; and it is per- 
haps that part that I am supposed 
to talk about most today. They are 
never separate in human life, and 
they will not be separate with the 
new computers of the International 
Business Machines either. 


Substitute for Experiment 


“The use of computation to extend 
understanding is, of course, not new. 
It characterizes the whole of scien- 
tific life in the last centuries. But 
there is something new about tne 
high-speed computer. I want to over- 
simplify and almost parody what this 
is about by stressing one element of 
it. The high-speed computer, in cer- 
tain areas, is a sort of substitute for 
experiment. It enables us to find 
out the connection between things in 
places where we have not the power 
(and I hope my examples will illus- 
trate why) to make those deliberate, 
controlled changes in the state of 
affairs which are the normal way 
that we try to disentangle things. 

“That is one pre-condition. And 
the other pre-condition is that the 
subject has to be mathematically 
kind of obstinate and tough. You 
do not want a high-speed computer 
for something you can do by the 
classic methods of analysis. 


Used for Complex rropiems 


“In practice this means that one 
applies computers primarily to prob- 
lems which are complex and which, 
in the technical phrase, are deeply 
non-linear. That means, in a non/ 
technical phrase (and I hope my 
colleagues will forgive me for it), 
problems in which the effects are not 
the sum of the effects of the causes, 
in which every constellation of what 
actually goes on has a kind of 
uniqueness and cannot be put to- 
gether out of similar simpler cle- 
ments. Most of the problems that 
have yielded to high-speed comput- 
ing, and many that are on the books 
for the future, have this characteris- 
tic, and in that they go beyond the 
familiar mathematics of the last cen- 
turies. 

“I think I can illustrate this by tak- 
ing three examples. Two are familiar 
in the sense that a lot of work has 
been done on them. The third is for 
the books, for the future. |

“The first is the perpetual problem 


of weather. How does the atmos- 
phere act? And this, as everyone 
knows, is a complex problem in 
strongly non-linear hydronamics. 
Great progress is being made in us- 
ing rough information about the 
state of the atmosphere today to 
know something about the state of 
the atmosphere tomorrow-—and that 
this will be of practical importance 
1 need hardly add. 

“What will come out of it, too, is 
that after the accumulation of ex- 
perience, which in this case is not to 
take weather readings so much as to 
do calculations, and check them oc- 
casionally against weather readings 
to see whether you got the point of 
that particular situation, a new kind 
of order and simplicity will emerge, 
because we will know what makes 
a difference, we will know what is 
important, we will know what is 
trivial, we will even know (even 
though I think it in this case un- 
likely), whether we have forgotten 
some very deep or surprisingly new 
point. 

“A second example, that is even 
more striking, it this; We from time 
to time get messages of immense 
stellar explosions which may have 
taken place some hundred million 
years ago. It is hard to do experi- 
ments with those things. No one can 
go back a hundred million years, and 
no one wishes to go out a hundred 
million years into space in order to 
learn what effect mankind, if he then 
survives, will see two hundred mil- 
lion years from now. And yet it is 
of great interest and excitement, and 


a challenge to man’s imagination, 
to try to figure out what causes these 
great events. This is also a deeply 
non-linear problem, in all likelihood 
a problem where the fundamental 
laws are known, a problem where 
the mathematical unscrambling will 
be the payoff. 


Aids Atomic Research 


“The third example is a more mod- 
est thing, but also in its way striking, 
and that has to do with the state 
of affairs, not in an exploding star, 
but in an atomic explosion. Here | 
think a whole new tradition of the 
use of computers and of computa- 
tional methods has been built up. 
And even today, when there have 
been a large number of atomic ex- 
plosions, the inside of an exploding 
bomb is not a cozy place to observe; 
a great deal of the normal experi- 
mentation is foreclosed by that, and 
by the cost and cumbersomeness of 
the effort. Initially, there was a 
much stronger argument, in that we 
did not have enough stuff to make 
an explosion. Then the important 
proving grounds of atomic bombs 
were the paper proving grounds in 
which one tries to see what ought 
to be going on. It is a rare, though 
not an unheard of event, that what 
happens in Nevada and in the Pacific 
tells us something important and 
new, that had not been found in 
this immense prior effort at under- 
standing. This has set, I think, one 
of the highest standards of analysis 
that has ever appeared in what we 
could call a generalized sort of engi- 
neering.

“In all of these efforts, one hopes 
for a lot. One hopes, first of all, out 
of the wealth of experience to get a 
simple view of what is at first quite 
a complicated phenomenon. One 
hopes that mathematics will eventu- 
ally catch up in its full analytic 
powers with the experience that the 
computers give. One hopes to find 
out what the important elements of 
the problem are, and whether models 
work. And one hopes, above all, to 
find out if one has been a fool and 
left out the mainspring of the phe- 
nomena one has tried to investigate. 


Useful in Genetics Study 


“It seems clear to me that in the 
statistical problems of genetics and 
of population studies, as in studies 
of economic models, experiment is 
also going to be a very costly and 
perhaps a prohibitive thing: thus | 
would expect that in these fields, 
too, the availability of computers 
could be of unmeasured value. 


“This is a new tool. It is a new 
tool, as was the microscope. It is a 
new tool, as are the tracers, the 
radioactive tracers, which have so 
recently become available to all 
branches of science. It is, as such a 
tool, a monument to man’s reason, 
in two ways: to its limitation, be- 
cause without experience, without 
Massive experience, we never get the 
point; to its power, because once we 
have experience, knowledge cannot 
regress, science can never be retro- 
grade. It is a tribute to deep mod- 
esty, and to the mind’s high splen- 
dor.”

IBM President Describes 701 Development 


The work of IBM engineers 
and scientists to develop and 
manufacture the highly intricate 
IBM Electronic Data Processing 
Machines in the short period of 
twenty-four months was de- 
scribed at the New York luncheon 
April 7 by Thomas J. Watson Jr., 
IBM. President. 

Introducing the younger Mr. Wat- 
son, Thos. J. Watson, who presided, 
suid that an idea and a personality 
were behind IBM's development of 
the new machines. 

“The idea back of the new calcu- 
lator was to build machines that 
would go far beyond anything that 
the company had accomplished be- 
fore,” he said. “And the personality 
behind the new machines was Thom- 
as J. Watson Jr., President of our 
company. He has followed the de- 
velopment of the new machines, 
sometimes day and night, from the 
very inception of the idea. He has 
taken the entire responsibility for 
the executive staff all the way 
through. This was an extra project 
assigned entirely to him and he has 
carried it through: in a way that 
has made all of us happy and well 
satisfied with the result. 


Presents IBM President 

“I present Thomas J. Watson Jr., 
President of IBM.” 

The IBM President said that it 
was a difficult task to follow Dr. 
Oppenheimer with any discussion of 
mathematical computers because of 
the honor guest’s great authority in 
such matters. 

“My discussion will be confined 
to just how the new machines were 
developed in our business,” he said. 
“Following my remarks we will go 
downstairs to the calculator room 
to see how the machines actually 
work. 

“As Dr. Oppenheimer has ex- 
plained, men have been trying to 
simplify and mechanize arithmetic 
problems for thousands of years. 
The machines we present today con- 
stitute another step along the way, 
and not the last step. 

“As you enter the calculator room 
please notice the Pascal computer 
which is mounted at the left of the 
entrance. This computer was built 
30U years ago by the son of a French 
customs collector who was kept up 
lute nights figuring customs duties. 
He invented a machine to solve the 
problem, a simple machine which 
probably was the first mechanical 


computing machine to be built. The 
principle of the big machines you 
will see demonstrated is essentially 
the same as the principle of that 
first machine. Over the years man 
has added capacity, flexibility and 
speed. but nothing more. 
War Heightened Demand 


“After World War II the demands 
for automatic computing increased 
tremendously. We had a tremendous 
shortage of mathematicians and en- 
gineers. Employers wanted to free 
their staffs for conception rather 
than repetitive thinking, and it was 
particularly important that the pro- 
totype model of a missile, an air- 
plane or a jet engine work cor- 
rectly, because of the very high cost 
of producing that prototype. 

“For example, in the aeronautical 
field, where this machine will do 
much work, the prewar airplane re- 
quired 70,000 man-hours of engi- 
neering. In the postwar airplane, a 
little bigger, 12,000,000 man-hours 
of engineering were required. That 
gives you an idea of the problems 
that exist in the areas in which we 
work. 

“The tremendously increased cost 
of engineering and computation re- 
quired new tools. and in the period 
trom 1946 to 1950. 1BM) built a 
hamnber of partial answers. We have 


some 1,200 electronic computers of: 


medium size in the field at the mo- 
ment, and these computers height- 
ened our knowledge of the field and 
heightened the desire on the part 
of a few customers for a much more 
powerful tool. 


“After the start of the Korean 
crisis, greatly increased defense ac- 
tivity in the aircraft, the atomic 
energy and the munitions manufac- 
turing fields increased the demands 
for machines capable of engineering 
computations of the highest order. 
IBM was anxious to contribute in any 
way it could to the defense effort. 


Research Is Expanded 


“Our electronic research had ex- 
panded greatly after the war, and by 
1950 our people felt they had com- 
ponents which, if put together, could 
make the very large capacity tool 
that industry wanted. We developed 
a paper plan and decided perhaps 
we could get interested people to 
indicate to us that they wanted such 
a machine. Our engineers made a 
trip to the West Coast and came 
back with tentative orders for eight- 
een. Then, because of the complexi- 


ties of the problem, the engineers 


and mathematicians of the people 
who were going to buy the machines 
sat down with our own engineers 
and scientists and agreed on the de- 
sired operating characteristics of the 
machines. 


Handles Tough Problems 


“Many of you may wonder how 
long it will be before these machines 
will be in use in your office. At pres- 
ent the new machine is so costly to 
build that you must have a compli- 
cated problem before it is applicable. 
As Dr. Oppenheimer said, the prob- 
lem must be obstinate and tough. 
If any of you have obstinate and 
tough problems we will be delighted 
to apply a machine to them. 

“As transistors and other types of 
components make this equipment 
less expensive, we think the office 
equipment industry will present ma- 
chines which will be applicable to 
many jobs which are not now me- 
chanized. 

“Our scientists, engineers and pro- 
duction people have an unusual rec- 
ord in the production of these ma- 

chines. Just twenty-four months ago 
one of our scientists sat down in my 
office and said, ‘I think we could 
do such a job.’ At that point the 
machines were not even on paper, 
but now, twenty-four months later, 
we are presenting the second ma- 
chine we built. 

“I would like to mention by name 
all of the scientists who contributed 
to the machines. Many of them are 
sitting with you at your tables. But 
I am afraid that the time is too 
short, as we want to show you the 
machines. 

“The machine will be demonstrat- 
ed by Dr. C. C. Hurd, Director of 
our Applied Science Division. Dr. 
Hurd came to IBM from the Atomic 
Energy Project at Oak Ridge, where 
he was one of the research directors. 
He has been a tremendous help in 
the scientific side of our business, 
and he is able to make these com- 
plex ‘machines and the complex 
problems they do sound relatively 
simple, which is no mean task. 

“Dr. Hurd’s demonstration will 
take just a few minutes, and for the 
rest of the afternoon he and his as- 
sociates will be available to answer 
any questions of the scientists who 
are here. 

“We thank you very much for 
coming, and thank you for your at- 
tention.”
