(Received July 18, 1932) 


In this paper we consider the behavior of electrons with energy very large com- 
pared to their proper energy in their passage through matter, and further treat the im- 
pacts suffered by a certain type of hypothetical elementary neutral particle whose 
existence was tentatively suggested by Pauli. In the introduction we outline the 
problem and the methods to be employed, and give a summary of the formulae which 
embody our results. In Section I we develop the method suggested by Mller for the 
relativistic treatment of impacts; in (a) we apply it to the impacts of two free electrons; 
in (b) we show how it is to be applied to those impacts of a fast electron in which 
little energy is transferred to the secondary; in (c) we develop the theory of the mag- 
netic neutron, and apply Mdller’s method to the treatment of its impacts. In II we 
give the detailed calculation of the energy transfers from a fast electron to the elec- 
trons of the matter through which it is passing, and compute the range and ionizing 
power of the primary electron. In III we apply the theory of the neutron to compute 
the number and nature of its impacts. 


INTRODUCTION 


ECENT experiments on the cosmic rays and on the penetrating radiation 
produced in the artificial disintegration of beryllium have raised again 

the question of the behavior of particles of very high energy in their passage 
through matter. Both these radiations have been shown to be extremely 
penetrating; and cloud chamber photographs have shown that both are ac- 
companied by electrons of velocity very close to that of light; in the case of 
the cosmic rays the presence of electrons of energy over 10° volts has been 
established. The range of such particles, the number and nature of the sec- 
ondary particles produced in their passage through matter can be computed 
theoretically. It has seemed to us desirable for a better understanding of the 
nature and properties of these radiations to have a more complete theoretical 
answer to these questions than is available. We shall, in this paper, be con- 
cerned with the behavior of two types of particle; chiefly we wish to study 
the electron of high energy; energy large, that is, compared with the proper 
energy mc”. But we shall also study the impacts of a certain type of neutron, 
a hypothetical elementary neutral particle carrying a magnetic moment. This 
particle necessarily has a spin and presumably satisfies the exclusion princi- 
ple; its existence was tentatively proposed by Pauli,’ on the ground that by 
its introduction certain difficulties in the theory of nuclei could be resolved, 
and on the further ground that such a particle could be described by a wave 
function which satisfies all the requirements of quantum mechanics and rela-

nition of the magnetic neutron at a seminar on theoretical physics in Ann Arbor in the summer 
of 1931.

tivity. These requirements, for instance, show that an elementary particle can 
have a magnetic but not an electric dipole moment; they do not suffice to fix 
the magnitude of the moment nor of the mass of the particle. Pauli supposed 
that such neutrons might form a third element in the building of nuclei, in 
addition to the electrons and protons; in this way one could understand the 
anomalous spin and statistics of certain nuclei, and the apparent failure of 
the conservation of energy in beta-particle disintegration. Pauli accordingly 
supposed that the mass of the neutron was not much greater than that of 
the electron, and that its magnetic moment was small compared to the Bohr 
magneton. One may, however, assume that the neutron has a mass very close 
to that of the proton, and that such neutrons are substituted for pairs of elec- 
trons and protons in certain nuclei, instead of being added to them; such neu- 
trons would help explain the anomalous spin and statistics of nuclei, although 
they would throw no light on the beta-ray disintegrations. The experimental 
evidence on the penetrating beryllium radiation suggests that neutrons of 
nearly protonic mass do exist; and since our calculations may be carried 
through without specifying the mass or magnetic moment of the neutron, 
we shall consider the most general particle which satisfies the wave equation 
proposed by Pauli. [t is important to observe that there may very well be 
other types of neutral particles, which are not elementary, and to which our 
calculations do not apply; and for clarity we shall call the particle which 
satisfies Pauli’s wave equation a magnetic neutron. Certain of our results, 
such as the relatively great penetration of the particle, relatively rare im- 
pacts, and large mean energy loss per impact, characterize the behavior of 
any neutral particle. 

The collisions and range of beta-particles have been often studied theo- 
retically; and even the case in which the primary velocity of the beta-particle 
is very close to that of light has been studied by Bohr? in his classical theory 
of range. But Bohr used a classical model for the atom and the beta-particle, 
and a classical method for treating their interaction; and Bohr’s treatment 
of the close impacts involving large energy losses is even classically not free 
from ambiguity. A very complete quantum theoretical calculation has been 
made by Bethe? for the case that the electron has a velocity not comparable 
with that of light; and our first problem in this paper is to make this calcula- 
tion relativistically, so that it may be applied to electrons of energy very 
large compared to their proper energy. 

At first sight the semi-classical method used by Gaunt* would appear 
appropriate for our purpose. Gaunt’s method is semi-classical in that, in the 
quantum mechanical expression for the probability of excitation (ionization) 
of an atom, the matrix component of the interaction energy between primary 
and atomic electrons is in part replaced by a Fourier component, replaced, 
that is, by the matrix component for the transition of the atomic electron of 
the Fourier component of the potential of the primary electron. For transi-

tions in which the primary electron has a small change of momentum, small 
energy loss and small deflection, this method constitutes a valid application 
of the correspondence principle. And this method is readily extended to high 
velocity primaries, since we have now only to take, in place of the electro- 
static potential, the Fourier component of the retarded four-vector potentials 
of the primary as a perturbation which induces transitions of the atomic elec- 
trons. The method is, however, not very elegant, even for the computation 
of the probability of small energy losses, because it gives an incorrect and 
very large probability of transitions involving small energy losses but large 
deflections, transitions to the study of which it may not legitimately be ap- 
plied. We shall, therefore, not use this method; but in §II we shall give an 
outline of it, because it gives an illuminating insight into our formulae, and 
makes clear in a simple way the reason for the increase in ionization power 
with increasing energy of the primary. Quite recently Mgller® has given a 
beautiful method of treating the relativistic impact of two electrons. This 
method is based upon a refinement of the correspondence principle; it neg- 
lects higher powers of the interaction energy between the electrons, and the 
effect of radiative forces; but within these limits it is strict and unambiguous, 
and enables one to take account, not only of the relativistic variation of mass 
with the velocity of the electrons, but of the retardation of the forces between 
them, of the spin forces, of interchange and the exclusion principle. The 
method is applicable not only to the impacts between two free electrons, but 
to the impacts of a free and an atomic electron in which small energies are 
transferred; it is further applicable to the impact of a neutron with an elec- 
tron or proton; and it is this method which we shall use. In doing this we 
may take advantage of the fact that for energy losses very large compared to 
the ionization energy of the atomic electron we may treat both electrons as 
free; whereas for small energy losses we may neglect relativistic effects for 
the atomic electron, and, as it turns out, interchange. For extranuclear elec- 
trons there is a region of energy loss large compared to the binding energy and 
small compared to the proper energy where the two calculations merge and 
agree. For the neutron the probability of. small energy losses is small, and 
the binding of an atomic electron can be largely neglected. 

In §I then we shall give an outline of M@ller’s method, and its application 
to the three calculations; intimate collisions with an electron, collisions with 
a bound electron involving small energy loss, and collisions of a neutron. We 
shall have to discuss here the limitations imposed upon the method by the 
neglect of higher powers of the interaction energy and of radiative forces. 
These points cannot be fully settled without an adequate quantum electro- 
dynamics, since they involve questions whose classical analogue is the theory 
of the structure of the electron. But we shall see that our method gives an 
upper limit to the range and a lower limit to the ionizing power; and we shall 
see further that the neglect we have made is small of the order of the fine 
structure constant. We shall have to carry the details of the calculation of the

impact of two free electrons rather further than was done by Mller, and 
shall obtain a formula for the differential probability of a given energy loss, 
a formula which may be applied to the impact of an electron with an atomic 
electron for all energy losses large compared to the binding energy. 

In §II we shall treat impacts involving small energy losses, and compute 
the range and the number of primary ions for a beta-particle. In §III we shall 
carry through the calculations of the impacts of a magnetic neutron, and 
apply them for a few typical values of the constants characterizing the par- 
ticle. 

We shall give here a summary of certain of our results. Let the energy 
of the primary electron be | | 


E = emc? (T) 


and the binding energy of the second electron be J, and the energy lost by 
the primary be #’. We have to consider only collisions in which

_ Nore: After the completion of this work, a very interesting paper* of Heisenberg has come 
to hand. Heisenberg is concerned with the problem of the nature of cosmic rays; and he de- 
rives theoretical formulae for the range of high speed particles with which to compare the ex- 
perimental findings. Heisenberg’s formula for the range of a fast electron differs only very 
slightly from that which we have found (Vb); we do not believe that the application of our 
formulae would lead to sensibly different conclusions. Note added in proof: An outline of a 
derivation of a formula for the energy loss of a fast electron, by a method also based on 
Méller’s and altogether similar to that used by us in II, has been given in a recent paper 
of Bethe (Zeits. f. Physik, 76, 283 (1932)), 


I. RELATIVIsTIC THEORY OF JMPACTS 


~The method which Mgller proposed for the relativistic treatment of im- 
pacts is a generalization of two familiar elementary methods; the nonrela- 
tivistic collision theory of the quantum mechanics, and the theory of the 
transitions induced in a quantum mechanical system by a known electro- 
magnetic field. According to the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, we can 
write down the interaction energy V of the two particles which are colliding 
as a function of the coordinates (and in some cases momenta) of the particles; 
for two electrons this energy is just the electrostatic interaction energy. We 
can further specify the stationary states of the non-interacting particles by 
certain quantum numbers 7, p, e.g., the components of momenta of the two 
particles. In the matrix scheme in which these quantum numbers are diagonal 
there will be a matrix V,,°* which corresponds to the interaction energy. 
Then with neglect of higher powers of the interaction energy, and with suit- 
able normalization, the transition probability for a transition in which the 
one particle changes its state from s—»r and the other from o—> will be given 
by

(The energy of a particle in state r is written #,; and 6(x) is the delta func- 
tion.) Further, when we know the wave functions for the particles in their 
non-interacting stationary states 


We = Uge WBF) Bet 


(1.2) 


We = Uge 28h) Egt 


we can compute the matrix V,,.°7: 
a | { drdr’itii,'Vusu,’ . (1.3) 


(Integral over configuration space r, r’ of two particles.) Now when we are 
dealing with particles whose velocity is close to that of light, we must of 
course use relativisitic wave functions to characterize their stationary states; 
there is no difficulty in doing this. For the electron we must use solutions of 
Dirac’s wave equation; for the neutron we may use solutions of the wave 
equation given by Pauli. But the function V no longer exists, since one can- 
not, when the retardation of the forces is taken into account, express the 
interaction energy as a function of the coordinates and momenta alone. What 
then, in the relativistic theory, should replace the matrix element V,,°7? 

We can answer this question if we consider first the perturbation induced 
in a quantum mechanical system by a given electromagnetic field. Let the 


four-vector potential of the field be ¢y(x, y, 2, t); w=1--- 4, and the charge 
and current density vector of the system be 

Je = pp, (1.4) 
Then 

Ses 1/chyj* (hs) 


is the operator representing the interaction energy of field and system. We 
resolve this operator in a Fourier integral 


V = [ Vacs V, = (— 1/cj*) [ eto. (1.6) 


To V, there now corresponds a matrix in the scheme of the stationary states 
without field | 


Vier = [ wVnede. — (4.7) 


Here, again neglecting higher powers of the interaction energy, we find for 
the transition probability 


An? /h| V7 |? 8(E, — Ey — hy). (1.8) 


Now when the field ¢, is produced by a particle of known trajectory, a tra- 
jectory uninfluenced by the reaction of the system upon it, we express the 
potentials in terms of the retarded charge and current density J” of this 
particle:

This at once suggests that, when the trajectory of the particle is influenced 
by the reaction of the system, so that the state of the particle also changes as | 
a result of the interaction, we replace the Fourier component of the retarded 
potentials of the particle by the matrix component corresponding to the transi- 
tion in question. Thus if again _

This reduces to (1.3) when retardation may be neglected and the velocity 
of the particles is small compared to that of light; it reduces to (1.11) when 
the reaction of the system on the particle may be neglected. 

This is the formula proposed by Mgller.5 Although the derivation of the 
formula distinguishes between the system and the particle, the result which 
we obtain for V;s°" when we reverse the roles of the two 


C= 17¢7) Jf dedet atin eB, tel. 


gives the same transition probability, and the same matrix to represent the 
interaction energy. 

We are thus led to consider the interaction energy represented by the 
matrix (1.12), Ve". One might at first suppose that by the use of this expres- 
sion for the energy, and the higher approximations of the method of variation 
of constants by which the transition probabilities may be computed, one 


770 J. F. CARLSON AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


could obtain a strict expression for these transition probabilities. This is not 
so, however, because in the derivation of (1.12) the reaction of each particle 
to its own field had been neglected; this reaction should be taken into ac- 
count in any strict theory, and its omission makes the higher approximations 
—involving higher powers of the charge or moment of the particles, invalid. 
‘Thus (1.12) gives no account of collisions between the particles in which ra- 
diation is emitted; but we know that such transitions will in fact occur. Their 
relative frequency, frequency relative to the transitions in which no radiation 
is emitted, is known to be of the order 


a(o/c)? (1.13) 
where « is the fine structure constant, and d the mean velocity of the charges. 
This probability can thus be neglected when one of the particles moves with 
a velocity small compared to light; even when this is not so, radiative pro- 
cesses are presumably relatively rare because of the smallness of a. We shall 
see that in our theory of the impact of a high velocity electron upon matter 
the impacts in which very little energy is lost are the only ones of importance. 
But in these impacts the secondary electron has very low velocities, so that 
we know that radiative processes cannot be important in these impacts. For 
this reason the results we obtain with neglect of radiative forces furnish a 
lower limit to the ionizing power and energy loss of the fast electron. On the 
other hand the formulae derived from (1.12) for impacts in which large en- 
ergies are transferred may be seriously in error; this error is at least of the 
order a. 

When the two colliding particles are electrons, (1.12) must be modified 
to take account of interchange and the exclusion principle. When the inter- 
action energy matrix corresponds to an operator in configuration space, it is 
known that this may be done by writing for the interaction energy

r,8 p,e 
and by treating the a’s as dynamical variables which satisfy 


ApUs + Got, = O 
Apt Ag + Apap = Spa; (1.15) 
ajtagt + a,ta,t =0. | 

The order of the a’s has been so chosen that the interaction of each particle 
with its own field has been eliminated. Now although V,,°* corresponds to no 
operator in configuration space, and there is no wave equation in the con- 
figuration space of the two particles with which to compare our results, we 
still take (1.14) to represent the interaction energy. Since each a,* corre- 
sponds to a transition in which a particle enters the state 7, and each a, to 
one in which a particle leaves the state 7, there are now four terms in this 
sum which give rise to a transition in which the two particles go from the 
states s and ¢ tov and p. Because of the symmetry of V,,°", these four terms 
are equal in pairs; for the transition probability we find, in place of (1.12)

In dealing with the impacts of a fast electron on an atom, it is easy to see 
that when the energy transferred to the atomic electron is small the inter- 
change terms in (1.16) are negligible; for such impacts we may use (1.12) in 
place of (1.16). 

We have now to apply these formulae to the three cases: (a) Impacts of 
two free electrons. (b) Impacts of a fast electron with an atomic electron, in 
which little energy is given to the secondary. (c) Impacts of a neutron with 
an electron or proton. 


(a) High velocity impacts of free electrons 


To apply (1.16) to the impacts of two free electrons we have to write down 
explicitly the wave functions for the stationary states of the free electrons 
and the expressions for the matrix components of the charge and current 
vector. The states of each electron we may specify by giving the components 
of momentum 


p? = (b2, py, P); P® = (po, Py, pe) 


and the component of spin o™, o® of each electron in the gz direction. (We 
exclude states of negative energy; and to the approximation here considered 
this causes no ambiguity.) For each of the electrons we take the wave func- 
tions to be solutions of the equations 


[(4/2mi)(8/at) + (hc/2ri)(a grad) — aync? |p = 0 (Lot) 


in which for each electron we take the a’s in the familiar form

and with the a,,? functions of (p, 7). For an electron initially at rest we take

These states will be characterized by an index (0). Thus 
p™ = 0, EO = me; ¢ = + 1; etc. 


This wave function represents a uniform electron density of one electron per 
unit volume. For an electron moving in the g direction we take

a1= —Np/g a. = Np./g 
a3 = N a= N

g=me+ E/c 
and 


iN? = Og (£2 — mic4)1/2, 


These states will be characterized by a superscript (2). This wave function is 
normalized to represent a stream of unit flux, so that the transition probabili- 
ties computed from it will give directly the cross section for scattering. 

We may without loss of generality suppose that after impact both elec- 
trons are moving in the xz plane, since, as we shall see, momentum is con- 
served in the impact. For such an electron we take 


oc=+1 g=-—t!l 
a= —Np./g u= — Np./g 
dy = — Np./g a2 = Np./g (1.22) 
a3 = N ag = 0 
d4 = 0 ag= N 
where , 
g=mce-+ E/c 
and 
N? = — g¢/2Eh', 


These states will be characterized by superscripts (1) and (2). This wave 
function is normalized to dp, dp, dp, =dp. We shall need the Jacobian 


J = (pp ,pO)/0(E® + B® 6 ,g%) 
where, by the conservation of momentum, 
E®(p@) = E®@(p@ — p), (1.23) 
We find

is J” that we must use to take out the 6(E-+ E®) —(#%+ EH) in (1.16). 
We are indebted to Dr. Heisenberg for tellung us that Mgller had found an 
error at this point in his paper.

Further if we divide (1.27) by V we get the cross section for impact with a 
single electron at rest. In (1.27) we have to consider all the possible orienta- 
tions of spin of the two electrons in initial and final states: to take one fourth 
the sum of (1.27) over the sixteen combinations of values of ¢, 6, 0, o®, 
The resulting cross section can be expressed as a function of e and ?, the 
angle of deflection of one of the electrons; it is independent of the azimuth 
of deflection of this electron; and all the components of momentum are de- 
termined by the conservation laws when @ and ¢ are given for one electron. 
Before carrying out this reduction we may make a few observations on the 
geometry of the impact. 

According to the conservation laws, if the two electrons after impact have 
direction of motion making the angles 31,02 with the g axis, 


oY sind: = p™ sin de. (1.30) 
Further, the energy of a particle coming off at an angle? is 


= = 2 a ° 
E! = mc eee ee (1.31) 
2+(e—1)p2’ B=sing; | 
and the absolute value of its momentum is mc [2a(e—1)!/2|/[2+(e—1)6?]. 
Thus the particle with the smaller energy always comes off at a larger angle; 
when the energy is shared equally the two particles come off at the same 
angle J», such that 


sin?d,, = 2/(e + 3). ~ (1.32) 
In general the angle y between the particles is | 
tgy = [2 + (e — 1)87]/[(e — 1)o8] (1.33) 
which reduces to | | . 
y? = (2me?/E’)(1 — E'/E) (1.34) 


for large e. [Here E’ is the smaller of the two energies E®, E®.| In no im- 
pact do both electrons come off at an angle larger than J; and since (0. 7) 
gives the probability that an electron come off at an angled, and the other 
at the corresponding angle determined by (1.30), we have only to consider 
impacts in which ? S$?,,; impacts in which }>¢d,, will be the same impacts 
as those for which 3? <?,,, but in which the angle 3 refers to the slower and 
not the faster of the two electrons. 

We should note that by (1.34) the angle between the electrons grows small- 
er as the both the primary energy and the energy transferred grow large 
compared to the proper energy. This point is of some importance in connec- 
tion with the interpretation of cloud chamber experiments, since it leads us 
to expect that very high energy secondary electrons produced by elastic im- 
pact with high energy primaries will come off nearly parallel to the direction 
of the primary. | 

We shall let then? be the angle which the faster of the two secondary elec- 
trons, for which we use (1), makes with the primary direction. Further we

For large € the last six contribute nothing to the cross section; the first four 
are important for energy losses not large compared to the proper energy; 
the next four are important for all energy losses comparable with the proper

energy; the next two are important only for energy losses comparable with 
the primary energy. From (1.35) the energy transferred is 


A’ = mee + 1)¢/2 + ¢. (1.38) 
We must consider only impacts for which

For these the differential cross section is given by 


Qnet dH! EA + B44 (E— EDS

(1.40) 


This concludes our study of the impacts in which large energies are trans- 
ferred. Certain further calculation by this method, primarily for the case of 
smaller e, were given® by Mgller; and there, too, the connection between cer- 
tain results of this calculation with earlier attempts at the calculation of 
impacts were given. One point we may mention here: when € is not large, we 
may use Rutherford’s formula to give us the differential cross section for en- 
ergy loss,—or rather the nonrelativistic quantum mechanically extension of 
Rutherford’s formula which takes account of interchange and the exclusion 
principle. This gives, for H’<E, 


odk! 2 2ne!dE!/ EE". (1.41) 


This agrees with our result for energy losses small compared to the proper 
energy; but for larger energy transfers it gives too large a cross section. When 
higher powers of the interaction energy are not neglected, terms of the order 
of the fine structure constant must be added to (1.40). In the case of the 
nonrelativistic calculation (1.41) these are only of importance when £’ is 
of the same order as E; and presumably, although not certainly, these terms 
will not be of importance for large ¢ except in this case E’~E£. 


(b) Small energy transfers to bound electrons 


We have now to consider the case that a primary electron of very large 
energy gives to a secondary which was originally bound in an atom an energy 
not comparable to its proper energy. The states for the primary electron are 
still given by (1.21) and (1.22); but certain simplifications are introduced 
even here by the fact that the energy of the primary changes very little. For 
practically all such impacts involve a very small deflection for the primary; 
and in their treatment it is legitimate to neglect quantities which are small 
when the primary momentum changes by a relatively very small amount. 
With this understanding we see that only the matrix components of the 
charge and current of the primary in which the spin of the primary does not 
change are important, and that these are independent of the original orienta- 
tion of the primary spin, which we may thus take parallel to z. (Caseg= +1). 
Further the components of current, and thus of vector potential, in the «xy 
plane, are negligible. We have to consider only the scalar potential and the z 
component of the vector potential of the primary. 


IMPACTS OF FAST ELECTRONS 777 


There are two further simplifications. In the first place interchange is 
negligible (interchange terms are important in general only when the energy 
transferred in of the order of the primary energy); we may thus use (1.12) 
in place of (1.16). In the second place the secondary electron never gets a 
velocity comparable with that of light, so that for it we may use nonrelativis- 
tic wave functions and expressions for charge and current density; and we 
may neglect the spin of this electron. On the other hand we may not use wave 
functions which neglect the binding of the atomic electron, and must replace 
for it (1.19) and (1.21). Let the initial energy and wave function of the elec- 


tron be 
EO = — Ty hy = e2rilnttygy (1.42) 


After the impact the atomic electron may be excited or ionized. Let the corre- 
sponding energies and wave functions be 


Ent Val aoa eC ari/hEnity, y: 


| (1.43) 
&, Vel — eC erilhity ny): 


where J stands for the two other quantum numbers in addition to the energy, 
necessary in the most general case to specify the state of the electron. Further 
let the continuous wave functions for energies above the ionizing potential 
be normalized in the energy scale. 

The expressions for the charge and current density are ethan simply 


p= opp 
(¢/2m) |(h/2ni)(b grad y — grad yp) (1.44) 
— (2e/c)WAv| ~ (eh/2rim)p grad y. 


The terms in the vector potential A are of higher order in the interaction 
energy and may be dropped. 

If as before we let the primary electron be deflected in the plane, and call 
the angles of deflection again 3, ¢, we get from (1.12) for the probability of 
excitation to a state n, I: 


Aq%e4

and for the probability of ionization to a state of energy in the range dE

To get the total probability of excitation or ionization these expressions must 
be summed over u, /; to get the energy loss per impact they must be multi- 
plied by

778 J. F. CARLSON AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


and summed over /, summed and integrated over x and &. In the next section 
we shall evaluate these expressions as far as possible when we leave the atomic 
wave functions arbitrary; and we shall evaluate them in detail for the case 
that the wave functions are those of a hydrogen like atom. From them we 
shall find, for the differential cross section for an energy loss &’ large com- 
pared to the ionizing energy J, | 


odE! = Ine'dE'/mek” 


in agreement with (1.40); but for smaller energy losses we shall obtain results 
which differ very markedly from those given by (1.40). 


(c) Theory of magnetic neutron 

For the impacts of a neutron with a free electron we have again to use 
(1.12). Here the wave function for the electron before impact is given by 
(1.29); that after impact by (1.22); and the charge and current density of the 
electron by (1.24-5). We have only to find.the matrix components of the 
charge and current density of the neutron. 

The wave equation proposed by Pauli! for the magnetic neutron is simply 
related to the Dirac equation for the electron. In the absence of a field this 
latter may be written 


ly“p. — imc] = 0; pa = (— h/2ni) (9/08); po = (h/2ri)(4/dx)); 
l= 1,2,3 
yi? boyy = oy. (1.49) 


In the absence of a field this equation is to hold for the magnetic neutron, 
except that the neutron’s mass M must be substituted for that of the electron. 
In the presence of a field new terms are to be added to the wave equation: 


ly"p, — ic + P| = 0; P = ko F,,. (1.50) 
Here F,, is the field tensor, 


(1.48) 
where the y“ satisfy 


Cer ete ede rrr anes 
and x is a constant which is related to the magnetic moment u of the neutron: 
= p/4dec. (1.51) 


These terms are not altogether arbitrary. Thus o” must be an antisymmetric 
tensor; it may not involve the coordinates nor powers of the momenta higher 
than the first. Thus (1.50) turns out to be the only hermitian not identically 
vanishing possibility which involves the field strengths linearly. The fact 
that x is real is required by the hermiticity of the term; otherwise one could 
not interpret the wave function of a particle which was conserved. The sign of 
the term is arbitrary, and determines whether the magnetic moment of the 
neutron is parallel or antiparallel to its spin. 

From (1.50) one may deduce two conservations laws. One asserts that 
the divergence of the four vector 


SH = ptyd (1.52) 


IMPACTS OF FAST ELECTRONS 779 


vanishes, and gives the conservation law for the neutron density. The other 
OJ" /Ax* = 0; J# = (— w/2)(0/d)x(ptor’d) (1.53) 


gives, as we shall show, the conservation of the charge and current vector. 
The two four vectors-particle density and flux, charge and current density, 
do not, as in the case of the electron, differ merely by a constant factor. 

The first justification for calling 4 the magnetic moment of the neutron 
we obtain if we reduce (1.50) for the case of velocities small compared to that 
of light. We find then that the neutron is described by a two-component wave 
function which satisfies 


[(h/2ri)(0/0t)— h?/8r?MA + p(H-c)]o = 0. (1.54) 


Here the o’s are the Pauli spin matrices 


0 1 Sf SG i © 
oc; = ) Oy 2 ) i ) (1.55) 
1 0 i 0 0 =—1 


and H the magnetic field. This is just what we should expect for the wave 
equation of a neutral particle carrying a spin and a magnetic moment yu. 

A further justification for calling w the magnetic moment of the neutron 
we can obtain by showing that. 


J* = (— p/2)(0/dx”) (gto?) (1.56) 


does correspond to the charge and current vector. For if we calculate the 
potentials and field strengths of a wave packet moving with low velocity by 
using (1.53) for the charge and current vector, we get just the field we should 
expect for the neutron of magnetic moment. Here as in the case of the electron 
the components of momentum do not completely specify the state; we need 
also to specify the orientation of the spin; and by doing this we determine the 
orientation of the field-producing magnetic moment. 

We can verify that (1.53) is right in the following way. The wave equa- 
tion (1.50) and its adjoint equation may be obtained by variation of d+ and ¢ 
in the Lagrangian. : 


L = [ avorlr'p, — iMc + xo”F,,|¢. (1.57) 
If we add to (1.54) the Lagrangian of the empty electromagnetic field, 
(1/167) f dVEWP., (1.58) 


and in this vary, precisely as in the familiar case of the electron, the poten- 
tials, we get in place of Maxwell’s equations for the empty field 


AF! /ax” = Ane (1.59) 


with J¥ given by (1.53). Thus, as far as the field produced by the neutron is 
concerned, J/# given by (1.53) acts like the charge and current density. It is 
a four vector, and its divergence vanishes. 


780 J. F. CARLSON AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


It is convenient to rewrite the Eqs, (1.50) in the form corresponding to 
(1.17). Thus for the free neutron (no field), we get 


[(h/2ri)(0/0L) + (he/2ri)(a- grad) — aMc?|y = 0 (1.60) 
where the a’s aid given by (1.18), if we take 
yt = a0; y' = tana; ¢ = tay. (1.61) 
The density current four vector then becomes 
Wy, cho. 7 (1.62) 


The neutron density is, as it must be, essentially non-negative. The terms 
corresponding to P in (1.50) then become 


— tagxo”’F (1.63) 

and the charge and current vector is given by |

It is not possible, without knowing the mass of the neutron, to reduce these 
expressions further. We shall, therefore, postpone until $III the discussion 
of these formulae. There, too, we shall make such elementary investigations 
of the effect of the binding of the electron as are necessary to our purpose. 
Before proceeding to the further application of this method of Mller, 
we wish again to emphasize the approximate character of the method. We 
have throughout neglected two things: the reaction of the particles to their 
own field, and all radiative processes; and higher order terms in the interac- 
tion of the two particles. In the case of the electron, both these neglects 
mean the omission of terms of the order of the fine structure constant, terms 
which are genuinely small unless both particles involved are moving with 
velocities comparable to light. Just what effect these terms could have on the 
things in which we are most interested—range and ionizing power of the pri- 
mary, energy distribution of the secondaries—we shall discuss when we have 
our results before us. But the formula (1.40), which is derived with neglect 
of these terms, is subject to grave doubt, since we have no assurance that 
terms of the form ea will not appear, and no physical assurance that in the 
intimate collision of two electrons this approximate method can be legit- 
imately employed. It seems at present by far the soundest method available, 
and perhaps experiment can show in what measure it is inadequate. The fur- 
ther study of impacts involving neutrons, a study which should not neglect 


782 J. F. CARLSON AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


higher powers of the interaction energy, presents even in the nonrelativistic 
case serious analytic complications; and we have not thought it advisable to 
attempt these without some more certain information about the characteris- 
tic constants, in particular the moment, of this hypothetical particle. 


II. IonizING POWER AND RANGE OF FAst ELECTRONS 


We must now consider in detail the small energy losses suffered by a fast 
electron in its impacts with an atom. Just as in the nonrelativistic theory, if 
we neglect the binding of the atomic electron we find an infinite probability 
for small energy losses; and just as in the nonrelativistic treatment the proper 
consideration of the binding gives us a finite probability of energy loss and a 
finite range. 

Before using our formula (1.46) to study these impacts we may outline 
briefly the semiclassical method of treating this same problem. This method, 
it will be remembered, is valid only for such impacts as involve small energy 
loss and small deflection of the primary; in this method we treat the primary 
particle classically, neglect the reaction of the atom upon it, and use the field 
calculated for this undeflected trajectory as a perturbation causing transition 
of the atomic electron. If we choose our coordinates so that the particle passes 
along the z-axis, and goes through the origin at =0, then the field of the par- 
ticle is given by the potentials 


A, = Ay =0; A, = (eve/c) |x? + y? + A(z — vf)? )?; 
$ = ee[x? + y? + (2 — wf)? }-1; 
where v is the velocity of the particle and 
t/e = (1 — 0?/c?)1/2, 


The probability of a transition of the atomic electron in which its energy 
changes by #’ is determined by the Fourier component of this field of fre- 
quency v’=E'/h. We therefore analyze the potentials by a Fourier integral: 


(2.1) 


A, = (4e/c) [ Komp/en cos 2rv(t — 2/v)du

The perturbation energy for the atomic electron is given by 
V = eb — (1/0)Ad. - 03) 


where j is the current operator which, to a sufficient approximation, is given 
by (1.44): 7,= (4e/2rm1)0/0z. Thus the transition probability for an atomic

Now for distant collisions, to which alone this method may be legitimately 
applied, we may expand the potentials about the position of the nucleus of 
the atom, which we take to be on the y axis at a distance from the track, 
and consider only the first two terms of the expansion, 1.e., the dipole moment 
of the atom. If we let the y-component of the displacement of the electron 
from the center of the atom be ¢ then we find 


Prn'(p) = (16me*/ hv?) | fan’ | 2[K’(Qarv’p/ve) |? (2.6) 
where K’(£) =0K)()/OE and Cnn = fin fundr. The nonrelativistic formula is® 
Pan'(p) = (16m%e/ hv?) | fan’ | 2K’ (20v'p/v) |. (2.7) 


Thus in this calculation the effect of retardation is to introduce p/e in place 
of p in the argument of K’. Since K’ is a rapidly decreasing function 


Ke) ole fore 2 0, 


(2.8) 
K'(&) Rie oss (1 /2&)1/2e-% for (£) => OO, 


this means that for a given transition and a given position of the atom the 
probability of a given energy loss is increased by considering retardation; 
energy losses occur at greater and greater distances from the track as the 
velocity of the primary approaches more and more closely that of light.We 
are, therefore, led to expect a greater number of low velocity secondaries 
than we should find from an extrapolation of the nonrelativistic formula; 
and this is just what we shall find. It is an immediate consequence of the flat- 
tening out of the field of the electron in the equatorial plane. 

As the position of the atom approaches the track, 0, and the total 
number of transitions becomes infinite. For these intimate collisions the ex- 
pansion of the potentials about p and the assumption that the track is unde- 
flected are both illegitimate. There are a number of ways in which, for small 
energy losses, we might try to modify the calculation of these close impacts, 
in such a way that the integral over converges and gives a finite result. Per- 
haps the simplest is to stop the integration at a point # where, according to 
(2.6), the probability of inelastic impact is unity. This point turns out to be, 
for a hydrogen-like electron, of the order of the Compton wave-length divided 
by the effective nuclear charge 2: | 


p = 1.4h/2emcze ~ h/2rmcez. (2.9) 


784 J. F. CARLSON AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


This procedure gives for the mean energy loss due to small energy transfer, 
small compared to the proper energy, 


6 = (4re*/mc*) In (mc*e/W) (2.10) 


where W is of the order of the ionizing potential J, and for a hydrogen like 
atom is W=3.0 I. This result is in remarkable agreement with that which 
we shall obtain by our strict calculations with the help of (1.46); and it is 
of some interest to inquire into the ground for this. The answer is very simple. 
We shall see that in our strict calculations (2.6) is right for distant impacts, 
impacts, that is, in which the deflection of the primary is negligible. For 
angles of deflection ? which are much smaller than | 


5 = (2mI)1!2/mce | (2.11) 


we get just this result (2.6), if we connect 3 and the parameter p by the dy- 
namical relation pd ~e?/mc’e. For larger? i.e., smaller , the transition proba- 
bility for transitions involving small energy loss decreases rapidly, instead 
of becoming infinite as it does by (2.6). Thus it is approximately right to 
break off the integral over p at a point | 


Dp ~ (e2/mered) ~ (h/2rmcz) 


and this is what, in these preliminary calculations, we have done. 

We must now turn to the strict calculation. We shall here be dealing only 
with small energy losses, and since our expressions converge very rapidly as 
the angle of deflection ? increases, we have only to evaluate them for small ?. 
As before, we shall assume throughout that ¢ is a large number, and neglect 
higher powers of 1/¢. We need to know the change of momentum of the pri- 
mary in terms of the energy lost #’ and the angle of deflection }. Thus, with 
these approximations,

In all cases the matrix integral may be written as the product of two in-

Thus

The former integral may be evaluated at once, and gives just, by (2.14)

The second integral may be considerably simplified, for it may be replaced by 


p2 = J deiiuerty with y = 2amce sind /h. (2.19)

gives a correction of the order, by (2.12), E’/mec? which is small of the order 
(v/c)? for the atomic electron, and negligible. If we neglect (2.21) in the first 
term the integral vanishes; and we have to show that here, too, this neglect 
is justified. But now the integral

and the corresponding matrix element vanishes. (This may be verified by 
direct calculation as far as the dipole moment of the atom is concerned.) 
The transition probability is thus given by | 


ERED { dy?| pam, ty y) | *1/C? + 0)7] (2.25) 


with 7 =27E’/hceand p2(n,1,y) = [drain uy. This expression may, of course, 
be evaluated when we know the u’s. We shall not need this evaluation to 
calculate the energy loss of the primary; but we do need it to compute the 
probability of ionization; and it is instructive to have the explicit expressions. 
We shall consider the very simplest case of an electron bound in the normal 
state of a hydrogen-like atom, with an effective nuclear charge zg; we shall 
calculate o for transitions to the continuum. We need to introduce the length 


1/d = h?/4n?mze? (2.26) 
and the quantum number 
n = 1/bk = 2ne®z/hv; k = 2nmo/h;v = (2E/m)*'!2 = [(2/m)(E’ — 1) |*/?; (2.27) 


which measures the energy of the secondary electron. If we now use parabolic 
coordinates with the pole along the x axis, and use the well-known wave 
functions for the hydrogen-like atom in such coordinates, we can evaluate 
not only ps, but the sum (integral) of |p2|? over all states / of the same energy. 
We thus find _

probability begins to fall off more rapidly with increasing angle of deflection 
when the angle grows of the order 


& = hb/2rmce. (2.30) 


This is the result quoted before (2.11) in connection with the semi-classical 
calculation. In this earlier calculation we neglected higher powers of y higher 
moments of the atomic electron—and thus replaced e~” by 1 —iyx. And this 
reduced expression becomes wrong when y~), 3~v. | 

For energy losses large compared to the ionizing potential the value of G 
for y—0 grows very small, and the integral over y comes entirely from the 


IMPACTS OF FAST ELECTRONS 787 


region y2-~&?; with neglect of higher powers of I/E’ the integral may then be 
evaluated, and gives just 


od Ei! = 2netdE! mek”. (1. 40a) 


This agrees with our result (1.40) for the energy loss to a free electron for 
E'<Kme*, 

We may use (2.28) to compute the cross section for ionization. For (1.40) 
gives a negligible contribution for high energy losses, and we do not need here 
to supplement it with the result (1.40). We so find, carrying out approxi- 
mately the quadratures over y and # for the cross section for ionization 


Cion = 0.29(2met/me?) In (mere? /0.0241). (2.31) 
The nonrelativistic result is, for this case of a hydrogen like’ atom 
Tion = 0.29(2re4/my*T) In (mv?/0.0242) (2.32) 


where v is the velocity of the primary. The two differ by (1.27e*/mc?)Ine for 
yv—c. The constant 1.2 is here computed only for the simple atom which we 
have considered; it depends upon the f-values for the atomic electron, and 
no universal closed formula can be given for it. We may get a somewhat more 
general result by comparing our formula with the nonrelativistic one. For 
(2.25) differs from the corresponding nonrelativistic formula in three points: 
(1) In the nonrelativistic formula c is to be replaced throughout by v. (2) In 
the nonrelativistic formula the quantity 7 in the denominator of (2.25) is to 
be replaced by 7’ =27E’/hv. (3) The upper limits of integration for y and E’ 
are greater in our formula. This third difference is not essential in computing 
the probability of ionization, since high energy loss impacts contribute rela- 
tively little to this probability. Now the nonrelativistic formula may always 
be written? 

Fion = ky(2re4/mv?) In (mv? / Rel). (2.33) 


By (1) this becomes 
ki(2re*/me*Z) In (mc? /Rol), | (2.34) 


and (2) may be taken into account in the following way. For the range 
O78’, y/b is small, and we may write 


J dete m~ = 4Y%Xn1,0, Xnt,o = J tounedr, 


Thus the term to be added to the nonrelativistic cross section is

Cion = ky(2re*/mc?l) In me*e?/ Rel. (2.36) 


This shows that the number of ions produced by a fast electron increases 
as its velocity approaches that of light. The ionizing power passes through a 
minimum for e~3; the increase is very slow; if we use the value of ke given 
by (2.31) for a hydrogen-like atom; and if for air we take J to be about fifty — 
volts, then the number of ions is double the minimum value for electrons of 
e~10°, or energy of the order of 10° volts. 

To compute the mean energy loss, and thus the range, of the fast electron, 
we might again use the hydrogen-like atomic model, and supplement (2.28) 
with the corresponding expression for the probability of excitation. But here, 
too, it is simpler to compare our expression (2.25) with the corresponding non- 
relativistic one. It is simpler still to use the sum theorem of Bethe?

where 7 = (27/hce)W, and W=s/ is an appropriately chosen mean value of 
the energy transferred per impact; and where the integration over y is to be 
taken up to the maximum value permitted by the conservation laws. We have 
here, however, to consider that the method used in the derivation of(2.25) 
is not applicable for large energy losses and large values of y, since it leads 
to (1.40a) in place of the correct (1.40). It is easy to correct for this, because 
of the fact that when 


E> (2.39) 


we may use the calculations of §I for free electrons. Since when (2.39) is 
satisfied the conservation laws are fulfilled, we know that in the range 
I<E’<mc? we may set 


E! = h?y?/8r?m. 3 (2.40) 
Thus if we integrate (2.38) up toa y value corresponding to an energy loss E:

we get a .

Noite: We get an upper limit for the range if we set

since this means that no large energy losses occur, and since we know that 
the neglects of our theory (radiative forces) can have no sensible effect upon 
the small energy losses. With 6£1!=0 we get asymptotically

which is four times the distance traveled according to the Klein-Nishina 
formula, by a gamma-ray before its first Compton encounter. This range 
(2.47) is just one-sixth the distance which (according to the Klein-Nishina 
formula) a quantum of energy (emc?) travels, on the average, before its 
first Compton encounter. Thus even for the greatest energies a gamma-ray 
is, according to theoretical results at present available, more penetrating than 
an electron of the same energy. It should be remarked that in the application 
of these formulae nuclear electrons may not, presumably, be neglected; they 
should be included in counting the total number (JV) of electrons per cc. But 
unless € is very large, the contribution of these electrons to the stopping power 
will be smaller than that of the extranuclear electrons, since the binding en- 
ergy of the former must be of the order of a few million volts. It seems at 
present impossible to extend our calculations to the case of electrons bound in 
nuclei, because of our ignorance of the nature of that binding. But insofar 
as wave mechanics is applicable to such particles, (2.46) should give a reliable 
estimate of their effect on a fast electron.

Ill. Impacts OF THE MAGNETIC NEUTRON 


We want now to study in a little more detail the expression which we have 
derived for the impact of a magnetic neutron with a free electron. The cross 
section for such encounters is given in (1.67) and the somewhat complicated 
quantities occurring in this expression are given in (1.69). We shall consider 
first and chiefly the case that the neutron has a velocity small compared with 
that of light; in this case it will be unable to give the electron a very high 
velocity, and we may greatly simplify (1.67) by neglecting higher powers of 
v/c for both particles. The complicated summation of the square of the 
numerators of (1.67) then reduces to 


ere er ee) pamle (3.1) 
and we find from (1.72) 
N = (1/2M%*) { p’4 + p’2(4r? — 8rAr + 2(Ar)?] + (Ar)#}. (3.2) 
Further the denomination of (1.67) becomes 
| p® =~ po | 2 = (Ar)? + ’2, (3.3) 


If we introduce for the ratio of the mass m of the secondary to that of the 


neutron 
= m/M (3.4) 


and the further abbreviations 
a = cosd, B = sind, g = [a + (2 — B227]/(44 +2, (3.5) 
we find | 
2nre'u? {e484 + g287[4 — 8(1 — gar) + 2(1 — go)*] + (1 — ga)4} 
~ a (1 = 2ge +g)? 
The energy transferred is 
fae (te A = Dees g2):, (3.7) 


Several points are at once clear. Since for a—1, g—>1 the cross section be- 
haves for small angles like | 


oda ~ da/(1 — a) ~ d8?/B? (3.8) 


whereas in the case of the Coulomb field it behaved like 
da/ (1a)? ~ dB?/B*. | (359) 


The mean energy transferred may be computed without considering the 
binding of the secondary, since 6E = foE’da converges. Further, the cross 
section is independent of the velocity or energy of the neutron, and the mean 
energy loss is directly proportional to the initial energy; finally the cross 
section is proportional to the square of the magnetic moment of the neutron. 

We shall reduce (3.6) for the case that the neutron has a mass equal to 
that of the secondary, \=1, or much smaller, X>1 or much larger \<1.

y 
oo = we'n?/mct, with n = w/ug; w= eh/tamc-n (3,12) 


where 7 is the magnetic moment of the neutron measured in Bohr magnetons. 
This quantity 2 is presumably quite small, so that oo is very small indeed. The 
expression for the total number of impacts 


ae [ede | Ga 


does not converge in the small angles. The preponderance of small energy 
losses is not nearly so marked here as for the impacts of an electron; and it is 
easy to show, by repeating the familiar nonrelativistic calculations for the 
‘impact of a particle with a bound electron, that the total number of impacts 
in which an energy of the order of a few times the binding energy or less in 
transferred is finite and independent of the primary energy and corresponds 
to a cross section of the order of oo. The total cross section thus turns out to be 


es [ oda ~ ool} In (E/W) — 7/16} (3.14) 


where W is of the order of the ionizing energy. The mean energy transferred 
per impact is thus 


SE/o ~ (E/24) In B/W. (3.15) 


Such a magnetic neutron, quite apart from the great infrequency of its im- 

pacts, a factor In?/4mc? smaller cross section than an electron—will never 

produce ion tracks in a cloud chamber, since it tends to lose an appreciable 

fraction of its energy, and suffer an appreciable deflection at every impact. 
A> 1. For this case we find 


Rv On (3.16) 
SE = (19/96)o.E/r (3.17) 
and forA<«1: | 
PHEW. (3.18) 
SE = 09E/8, (3.19) 


792 J. F. CARLSON AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


In both these cases impacts are relatively rare; in both, the mean energy 
loss is necessarily smaller than for equal masses; only for a heavy neutron are 
impacts without large deflection possible. If such a neutron as this had a large 
magnetic moment, large compared to the Bohr magneton, it could produce 
recognizable cloud chamber tracks; but values of 2 large enough to give this 
seem a priorz extremely improbable. 

The formulae we have given apply equally—especially to the impacts of a 
magnetic neutron with a proton or nucleus. They do not account very well for 
the phenomena observed in the penetrating radiation from Be bombarded 
with alpha-particles. In the first place, such a magnetic neutron would have 
more impacts with highly charged nuclei than with protons, whereas the ob- 
servations show that this is not so; in the second place the number of impacts 
would depend so little on the energy of the neutron, so that it would be hard 
to account for the observed inhomogeneous absorption of the radiation. 
Finally the distance between impacts would be enormous; with »=107 and 
A\=1, a neutron of 5.108 volts would travel~100 km before ejecting a visible 
proton from paraffin. | 

One might suppose that in the general case of velocities not small com- 
pared to that of light, different and more satisfactory results might be ob- 
tained. We have investigated this case only for \=1, in which case the con- 
servation laws give simple algebraic relations between angle of deflection and 
final momenta and energy. For this case the total cross section increases with 
e, where again # =eMc? is the initial energy of the neutron, and is of the order. 


oe" . (3 . 20) 


In this case €>1, the preponderance of small deflections and relatively small 
energy losses is still less marked than in the case of low velocity magnetic 


neutrons. When 
e >In E/W 


the electron tends to lose a large part of its energy in each encounter it makes. 
Such a neutron could not produce cloud chamber tracks; and since it is cer- 
tain on energetic grounds that the radiation from beryllium does not consist 
of such neutrons, we have not thought it desirable to give further details in 
the evaluation of (1.67). | 

We believe that these computations show that there is no experimental 
evidence for the existence of a particle like the magnetic neutron.
