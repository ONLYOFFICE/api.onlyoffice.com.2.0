ON THE QUANTUM THEORY OF THE 
CAPTURE OF ELECTRONS 


By J. R. OPPENHEIMER* 


ABSTRACT 


In Section 1 the method of a previous paper! is applied to find the rate at which 
a particles capture electrons from atoms. The mean free path for capture varies 
roughly with the sixth power of the velocity of the @ particle, and in good agree- 
ment with Rutherford’s experiments.’ The value of the mean free path is computed for 
capture in air, and agrees with the experimental value. 

In Section 2 the probability of radiative recombination of electrons and protons 

_is computed. The cross section for recombination becomes infinite for small relative — 

velocities with the inverse square of the velocity; for high velocities it is given by 
10—3 7-5/2, where W is the energy in volts of the incident electrons. 


N THE collision of an e-particle with an atom, one of the atomic electrons 

will occasionally be captured by the passing particle. In this capture the 
electron jumps from one bound orbit to another; and the energy difference 
in the binding is taken up in the relative translational energy of the two 
heavy particles. The initial and final states have the same energy; but the 
wave functions representing them are not strictly, orthogonal, since it is 
possible, though not very likely, that the electron, although “bound” to the 
atom, be found in the immediate neighborhood of the a-particle. If one 
writes out the scalar product of the initial and final wave functions, e.g., for 
hydrogen, 


e= f dt Yuvuet+Wat HY gt ( 1) 


where the integral is to be taken over the configuration space, one sees that, 
for large relative velocities, this becomes very small.2 The capture thus 
corresponds to a transition between almost orthogonal states of the same 
energy, and may be treated by the methods of ref. 1. For this one needs the 
form of the wave function in the initial state; we shall carry through the 
calculation for a hydrogen-like atom with arbitrary nuclear charge, and shall 
consider, subsequently, how, and with what error, this may be applied. 

This capture of electrons has been studied both experimentally* and 
theoretically. Our theory will give directly the mean free path for capture 
as a function of the velocity of the a-particle and the constants of the atom. 
This has been observed for a considerable range of velocities in air, and will 
give the most direct check on the theory. 

Fowler’s theory‘ of the capture is based on considerations radically dif- 
ferent from those of this paper. Fowler observes that the loss of the captured

electron of the a-particle may be regarded as a process of ionization by 
collision with one of the atomic electrons. (We shall adduce evidence that 
the process of loss is not precisely of this kind, but that is here irrelevant). 
The reverse process to this is a three body collision: two electrons strike the 
a-particle; one of them is captured, and the other carries off the excess energy. 
If now one imagines the electrons to form a gas at the temperature appro- 
priate to the velocity of the a-particles, and assumes that the system is in 
thermodynamic equilibrium at this temperature, one may use the principle 
of detailed balancing to compute the probability of capture from the proba- 
bility of loss by ionization; and this latter probability is approximately known 
from the classical formulae of Bohr. Fowler has carried through the calcu- 
lations on this basis. They yield, with certain not very unreasonable assump- 
tions, a satisfactory account of the experiments on the ratio of the number 
of a-particles with a captured electron to the number of bare a-particles in a 
beam that has been passed through a film of metal. 

The theoretical objection to this calculation is that it completely neglects 
the réle of the nuclei, and ascribes to the electrons a velocity relative to each 
other, and relative to the nuclei, which they have not in fact. We shall see 
later that encounters in which two electrons take part play an unimportant 
part in the process of capture. Empirically? this is confirmed by the fact 
that the experiments seem to demand a probability of capture proportional 
to the first power, and not the square, of the electron density. Fowler’s 
formulae may also be applied, with a slight modification, to the evaluation 
of the mean free path for capture in air. They give results which do not 
agree nearly as well as those of the present theory with the experiments, and 
which seem definitely unsatisfactory. 

We shall first compute the first order cross section® for capture into the 
normal state by an a-particle of mass M, charge 2e, and velocity V, for an 
atom with a single electron of mass m, charge —e, and with a nucleus of mass 
gM, and charge Ze. If we eliminate the motion of the center of gravity of the 
system as a whole, we may describe the relative motion in terms of the vector 
R from the center of gravity of the electron and a-particle to the nucleus, 
and the vector r from this same center of gravity to the electron. The wave 
function for the initial state, representing a unit stream of a@-particles per unit 
area, is then®

K=2ruV/h K=29MV/h. (3) 

5 The probability of capture has the dimensions of an area because the initial wave func- 
tion (2) is normalized to make the incident flux per unit avea per unit time unity. oA =[H]. 

6 The first two exponential factors give the translational motion of the atom and a- 
particle; the third gives the motion in the normal state of the atom of the electron about the 


center of gravity of the atom; the factor is chosen to make the flux of incident a-particles one 
per unit area per unit time.

Helium ion V’, is .

with 
ao= h?/4r2ye? ; K’=24MV'/h. 
This is normalized’ to dydw, where E=hy is the total energy of the final 
state, and dw is the element of solid angle of the unit vector s=V’/V’. The 


perturbing energy for the capture is the interaction energy of the a-particle 
and electron: 


Hy = (—2e/r)(u/m). (6) 
The matrix component of this which conserves the energy has a velocity V1: 
W=Vi; V2-Vit=(h2/4r2ul) (1/0?—4/a0"), (7) 


and is a function of the direction of Vi, or of the vector s:

(10) 

We have now to consider the validity of certain of the approximations 
involved in this calculation. It was shown in ref. 1. that, if the matrix 
element of 4, to some other final state—involving a transition which violates 
the conservation of energy—is much larger than that responsible for the first 
order effect, second order terms must be considered. The matrix elements of 
H, have maximum values for V’ parallel to V, and these values are sensibly 
independent of V’. In this case, therefore, the second order terms are negli- 
gible; and they may be shown, in fact, to vanish more rapidly than oo with 
increasing V. This applies also to transitions to excited states in Het. 

In evaluating H; we have neglected the term —2Ze?/R, which gives the 
interaction energy of the nucleus and the a-particle, and which gives rise to 
the Rutherford scattering. The contribution of this-term to the probability

of capture is only apparent, and arises from the fact that the wave function 
for the deflected a-particle and undisturbed atom is not quite orthogonal to 
that of the deflected a-particle with a captured electron. The contribution 
of this term to the cross section vanishes more rapidly than a with increasing 
V. 

The electron may be caught into one of the excited states of Het. The 
wave functions for these states corresponding to (4) are

where 2, k, m are the three quantum numbers of the Het orbit. If one uses 
(11) to estimate the probability of capture into the excited states, one finds 
that the contribution of states for which k+#0 vanishes more rapidly than ap 
by a factor V-*. The only important terms, for large V, for the states , 0, 0, 
are those arising from the first term of the Laguerre polynomials. Each such 
state has a transition probability

In the evaluation of H,(s) the exponent [r—R| was expanded:

The integral as it stands is difficult to evaluate, but we may control this 
approximation by setting

This introduces into the integral over R new terms of the form

These vanish more rapidly for large V than the terms retained. 

Part of the excess of energy of the electron in its initial state over that 
in its final state may be given off as spontaneous radiation; this may increase 
the probability of capture, in particular of capture into the normal state of 
Het. The cross section for radiative capture is®

where v1 = (h?/87uag")(Z?—4), and where P(j,s) is that component of the 
effective electric moment —er of the system which corresponds to a tran- 
sition to a state of energy h7, and a direction of relative velocity given by the 
vector s. The resulting matrix integrals differ from Hy; chiefly in having a 
factor r in place of 2e/r; and this introduces a factor x~‘e~? into the cross 
section. The ratio of o, too turns out? of the order of magnitude of 


o,/o=v3h?K/etaM cx. (17) 


For the range to which we shall apply our formulae this is about 10-7. Stimu- 
lated radiative transfers do not occur. 

These considerations give, for the mean cross section for capture in atomic 
hydrogen 


o=1.209= [210-4 /W2(W +135) | (18) 


where W is the equivalent electron voltage of the a-particle. This is valid 
only for velocities for which 50/ W may be neglected. 

For atomic hydrogen captures in which two electrons play a part can 
not occur. They may occur for other atoms, provided that the sum of the 
ionization potentials of the two electrons is less than the energy of binding 
in Het. But the coupling between the electrons is not very great—compared 
with the coupling of each to the nucleus—and one may expect such captures 
to be of the same relative importance as double ionizations in the theory of 
ionization by collision. One cannot estimate this very accurately without 
a more detailed knowledge of the periodic and aperiodic wave functions for 
the atom in question. But Fowler’s calculations offer a convenient upper 
limit, since they make encounters between electrons much more probable 
than they are in fact, and assume that any electron can absorb any quantum 
of energy. It will be seen that Fowler’s formula gives a cross section for 
capture by double encounter only about 1/100th of that computed by (10). 
As has been observed, the probability of the simple capture depends very 
little on the energy to be taken up by the nucleus. 

The most direct way, then, of adapting (18) to experiments on air is to 
neglect the interaction of the atomic electrons, and use, for the wave func- 
tion of each electron, that of the normal state of a hydrogen-like atom with 
such a nuclear charge Z, as gives the proper ionizing potential for the 
electron. This yields for \., the mean free path for capture, in air at N.P.T.,

where the summation is to be taken over all the electrons of the “air mole- 
cule.” The value of A}, depends only slightly on the ionizing potentials.!°

10 The oxygen molecule has twelve electrons with Z ranging from 1 to 1.7; and four with | 
Z=7.5. The nitrogen molecule has ten electrons with Z ranging from 1.1 to 1.7; and four with 
Z=6.5. Cf. Hdb. d. Physik, xxiii, 756-760, 1926.

Here », is the effective density for double encounters of “loosely bound” 
electrons. If NM be the number of such electrons per molecule, and G be the 
volume of the molecule, we may set, for air at N.P.T., 


ye=2.7X10"N(N—1)/G; N=10.4; G=6xX10-%,

To apply (19) to find the relative concentrations of Het and He*+ in 
a beam that has passed through air or metal, we must know the probability’ 
for the process of loss. There is some evidence that this is not a simple 
ionization by electron impact. In the first place, since the probability 
depends upon the square of the matrix component of the perturbing energy, 
the probability of ionization due to the nucleus should be Z? times that 
for the ionization due to an electron, whereas that due to all the electrons 
should be Z times that due to a single electron; for heavy atom the nucleus 
would thus be the more important. The second point is empirical. For the 
classical theory gives a probability of ionization which falls off with V~?; 
and one may readily see by writing down the matrix elements that, for large 
velocities, the quantum mechanics gives this too; this has been established 
in detail by Elsasser.!2 But experimentally Rutherford finds that the mean 
free path for loss varies, in a range for which Bohr’s formula should hold, 
as V1. It may be shown that the ionization due to a colliding dipole falls off 
less rapidly with increasing V than that due to a simple charge; so that both 
discrepancies may be resolved by taking for the ionizing particle the core 
of the atom. 

If one uses Bohr’s formula for the rate of loss, the method of this section 
leads to reasonable values for +1e ratio of the concentrations of Hett and 
Het. This ratio then varies 2.. V4, whereas Rutherford finds V4°.

combination from the known wave functions of the hydrogen atom." For, 
in spite of the fact that the aperiodic wave functions approach those of free 
particles only when the distance between the particles r is held constant 
and their relative velocity V is increased indefinitely, and not when V is 
held constant and 7 is increased, one can write down an initial wave in terms 
of these wave functions which, for large r, represents a unit incident beam 
per unit area, moving with a velocity V in a given direction (cos 6=0).

where g is the ratio of the initial translational energy of the electron to the

The extension of (5) to recombination for excited states offers consider- 
able arithmetic difficulties. For high velocities it is easy to modify (7) to 
take account of the excited states. For, for high velocities, the wave functions 
of the two body problem approach those for the free particles, and these latter 
become almost orthogonal to the periodic wave functions, and may be used 
to evaluate o. For the initial wave function we may thus take
