In view of the present results, however, it seems 
highly probable that they were detecting the 
formation of both K** and K*°. 


(b) The formation of K** from calcium 


In a previous paper? results obtained by one of 
us in a study of the radioactivities induced in 
calcium by deuteron bombardment were re- 
ported. It was noted that a weak activity was 
observed in the potassium fraction separated 
chemically from the irradiated metal. It was 
suggested that this might be due to contami- 
nation, though it was thought, in view of the 
fact that the half-period did not agree with that 
of any well-known contaminant, that it might be 
due to K38 formed thus: 


Catt H?>K384+ Het; K38>A38-4 et, 


Following the production of K?§ by bombarding 
chlorine with alpha-particles, a search was made 
for this isotope in irradiated calcium. It has a 
sufficiently short half-life to have been unob- 
servable in the previous experiments on account

of the time needed for the chemical separation 
adopted. 

Calcium metal was, therefore, bombarded with 
deuterons for half an hour and, following solution 
in HCI and the addition of inactive KCl, potas- 
sium was precipitated by means of perchloric 
acid and ethyl alcohol. In consequence the 
precipitate was contaminated with radioactive 
scandium.® However, on correcting for this it was 
found that K%8 was present, the decay curve 
corresponding to a _ half-period of 7.6+0.2 
minutes. This curve is reproduced in Fig. 5. 

The decay of this precipitate was measured 
until its corrected intensity was less than the 
natural leak of the electroscope, but no evidence 
was obtained of the 12.4 hour period of K*®. The 
expected reaction

In conclusion we wish to thank the staff of the 
Radiation Laboratory for their cooperation, and 
especially Professor E. O. Lawrence for his

The Disintegration of High Energy Protons

The coupling between light and heavy particles assumed 
in the Fermi theory of 6-decay makes it possible for high 
energy protons in passing through matter to transfer a 
considerable fraction of their energy to electrons and neu- 
trinos. If we suppose that this coupling is a maximum for 
relative energies of the light and heavy particles of the 
order fAc/R, with R the range of nuclear forces, and is small 
for much higher relative energies, the most important 
process which occurs, for sufficiently energetic protons, can 
be pictured as a sort of photodisintegration of the proton by 
the contracted Coulomb field of a passing nucleus, the 
proton changing into a neutron and emitting a positron and 
a neutrino. With a coupling of the type described, and of 


the magnitude required by the proton-neutron forces, 
processes involving more than one pair of light particles 
will be relatively rare. The cross section for the disintegra- 
tion of a proton of energy £ is found to be of the order 


2a(h/ Mc) RZ? \n? (A /Mc*), 


and is very small, even for heavy nuclei. The mean energy 
given to the positron per disintegration is of the order 


2(hc/R)(E/ Mc?) /in (E/Me?). 


The positrons emitted in these disintegrations can account 
in order of magnitude for the incidence of showers observed 
under thick absorbers.

1. SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE FERMI COUPLING 


“NTIL recently the only mechanisms known 
by which a proton could lose an appreciable 
fraction of its energy to electrons and y-rays were 
elastic impacts of the proton with extranuclear 
electrons, and the relatively insignificant radia- 
tion emitted by the protons deflected in nuclear 
fields. The Fermi theory of 8-decay provides a 
new mechanism for such energy transfer, because 
of the coupling assumed in this theory between 
the heavy particles (proton and neutron) and the 
electron-neutrino field. Owing to the weakness of 
the coupling necessary to explain the long life- 
times of the 6-radioactive substances, this effect 
would be extremely small if one were to take 
over unmodified the coupling used in the theory 
of 6-disintegration. However, a strong increase 
of the coupling with the energies of the particles 
concerned is suggested when one attempts an 
explanation of nuclear forces on the basis of 
Fermi’s theory. The question of the consequences 
of this modified Fermi coupling for the behavior 
of heavy particles of high energy thus needs 
investigation. 

An unambiguous answer to this question de- 
pends upon a satisfactory formulation of the 
problem of nuclear forces. The unsatisfactory 
character of present theories manifests itself in 
the occurrence of divergences in the method in- 
volved in their formulation, the method of 
successive approximations. This divergence of 
the method of successive approximations indi- 
cates that processes which from the point of 
view of this approximation are of high order, 
and which involve the cooperation of a large 
number of light particles, may be of dominant 
importance. The. point of view adopted by 
Heisenberg! in his theory of showers would seem 
to be that this feature of the present inadequate 
field theory will also be characteristic of a correct 
theory, and that just those implications of 
present theory which would at first seem most 
subject to suspicion can have a qualitative 
validity. 

Quite different from Heisenberg’s suggestion is 
the more usual procedure of avoiding divergences 
by the formal device of reducing the coupling 
between heavy and light particles for high

relative energies. In this wav one can account for 
the finite range of nuclear forces by taking a 
coupling which becomes small for electrons and 
neutrinos whose de Broglie wave-length is smaller 
than this range (~2xX10-" cm). When the 
constants of the coupling are adjusted to give 
not only the range but the magnitude of nuclear 
forces, it turns out that even at its maximum the 
coupling is rather small, so that the probability 
of finding an electron-neutrino pair in the 
neighborhood of a heavy particle is less than one 
in ten, and the probability of finding many such 
pairs is negligible. In fact, if one applies the 
“Born approximation,’ and regards the coupling 
as small, the parameter which determines the 
relative magnitude of successive terms in this 
approximation is #/McR, where R is the range 
of nuclear forces.? This model is now so much 
modified as compared to that of Heisenberg that 
it no longer affords any explanation of showers. 
This model makes it possible to give a quanti- 
tative estimate of the probability that a proton 
will disintegrate in its passage through matter 
into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino, and 
of the magnitude of the energy loss to light 
particles for which the Fermi coupling is re- 
sponsible. For very high energies such a dis- 
integration of the proton will occur for quite 
distant impacts with atomic nuclei. These dis- 
integrations may be thought of as a sort of photo- 
effect of the proton by the contracted Coulomb 
field of the passing nucleus. For sufficiently high 
energies thesedistantimpacts, which arerelatively 
easy to discuss, will contribute the dominant 
terms to the probability of proton disintegration.3 


2 Against the correctness of this formulation is the 
equality of the forces between proton and neutron and 
between proton and proton, since these appear in different 
orders in the Born approximation. It would seem that the 
electron-neutrino theory of nuclear forces could only very 
artificially be made to explain this equality, as well as the 
range and magnitude of the forces. The generalization of 
the $-transformation theory proposed by G. Gamow and 
E. Teller, Phys. Rev. 51, 289 (1937), would give the same 
order of magnitude for the proton disintegration effect as 
derived in this paper. 

3 For the range of energies actually found in the cosmic 
rays, the probability of disintegration through a direct 
impact of the proton and nucleus may be expected, on the 
basis of our model, to have a magnitude comparable to 
that of the process we discuss for light elements, but to be 
considerably smaller for heavy ones. In comparing the 
results of our calculation with the observed incidence of sea 
level showers, it should not be forgotten that we have not 
taken these direct impacts into account, and that their 
contribution may be sensitive to the model assumed. 


DISINTEGRATION OF PROTONS 


2. THE FORM OF THE COUPLING 


We investigate first the possibilities of formu- 
lating a modified and ‘cut-off’? Fermi coupling 
convenient for the treatment both of nuclear 
forces and of high energy disintegrations. 

The simplest form of the Fermi interaction 
energy is! 


Hex =G(me) (h/me) - (bu*Bee) (oe*Bvr)dr, (1) 


which describes the transition of a proton, P, 
into a neutron, N, with the emission of a positron, 
e, and a neutrino, v. Here the matrix £6 is the 
coefficient of the mass term in the Dirac equation 
written in its normal form, and the integrand 1s 
thus built up of the simplest scalars which can 
be formed from the Dirac wave functions of the 
heavy and light particles. G is a pure number 
which fixes the magnitude of the interaction. 
A coupling of the type (1) will lead to an inter- 
action between a neutron and a proton which, 
to the second order in G, is represented by the 
Majorana potential J(r)P™, given by 


LI (r)P™ w= 3 » { HTypVHpy™ 
+Hpy™Hyp™} /(ecte,), | (2) 


where the sum extends over all possible electron 
and neutrino states, with energies e, and e,, re- 
spectively, and the upper indices (1), (2) dis- 
tinguish the heavy particles. 

It is well known, however, that the coupling 
(1), with G determined to give the correct order 
of magnitude for the lifetimes of the 6-active 
nuclei (¢~107”), gives the result that J(r) is far 
too small for separations of the heavy particles of 
the order 10-8 cm, and is highly singular, 
behaving like 7-*, as r—0. In order to obtain a 
potential of finite range and depth, and proper 
magnitude, without violating the facts of B- 
decay, it is necessary to modify (1) so that: 

1. The order of magnitude of Hpy remains 
unchanged for energies of the light particles in 
the 8-decay region (<25 mc’). 

2. Hpy increases enormously for light particle 
energies of the order fc/R~137 me’. | 

3. Hpy-0 for still higher light particle 
energies, 


_ 4 The form of the spin dependence in (1) has been chosen 
because it gives Majorana forces. 


1039 


To obtain such a dependence of (1) on the 
energies we could, for free particles, simply 
multiply the integrand by a suitable amplitude 
factor f, which is an invariant function of the 
four-vector momenta of all the particles. For 
arbitrary states the interaction could then be 
found by superposition of the individual Fourier 
components. Since #/R«Mc we can choose a 
coordinate system in which the heavy particle 
velocities are small. In this system our invariant, 
f, must reduce to an arbitrary function of the 
energies of electron and neutrino and of the angle 
between their directions of motion. 

Thus our matrix element for the coupling 
becomes, in the rest system of the heavy particle 
(using plane waves for the electron and neutrino), 


Hpy=Glme')(h/me) { (dw¥8u) 


X (w*Byp)f(p, q) exp L(¢/hc)(p—q)-rjdz, (3) 


where u and w are the Dirac amplitudes for the 
electron and neutrino wave functions, and p and 
q are c times their momenta. 


For J(r) we obtain from (2) and (3), after carrying out 


- the summations over the spin variables in the usual way,° 


J(1) = exp [(¢/he)(p —q) -r] 


x<dpdq, 


G? |f(p, ; 2 
~~ (me?) *2( aa 


where r=1r,—r2 is the distance between the two heavy 


. particles. We can carry out the integrations over the direc- 


tions of p and q if we make the assumption that there is no 
coupling between the directions of emission of the electron 
and neutrino. Neglecting the difference between p and e, 
we find

The amplitude function f(p, g) has to be adjusted so that 
(4) gives the right magnitude and range for the nuclear 
forces. The former will be given correctly when the energy 
of the first stationary state of the deuteron is ~0. Because 


5 In the first term of (2) (emission of an electron and an 
antineutrino by the neutron and their reabsorption by the 
proton) the summation is extended over all positive energy 
states of the electron and negative energy states of the 
neutrino, in the second term (emission of a positron and a 
neutrino by the proton and their reabsorption by the 
neutron) over all negative energy states of the electron and 
positive energy states of the neutrino. The density of 
electron and neutrino states in our units is dpdq/(27hc)°.

when

as Bethe has observed.* An alternative expression of this 
condition is the phase integral

integration, the integral over a=r/hc gives

by (5a). When this coupling is applied to the 
problem of proton disintegration, it leads, be-

integrals. Since it is unlikely that any real 
theoretical significance is to be attached to 
this f, we have chosen instead a form which is 
convenient for calculation, and which satisfies

results depend little on ” and s, we shall choose, 
when it is necessary to fix them, the ‘‘com- 
promise’’ values s=4, n»=2. To the question of

3. CALCULATION OF THE CROSS SECTION 


The process of the disintegration of a high 
energy proton by the Coulomb field of a nucleus 
can be thought of, in the coordinate system in 
which the proton is initially at rest, as the 
emission by the proton of a positron and a 
neutrino, the positron then being deflected by 
the contracted Coulomb field of the passing

nucleus.? From this formulation we can see that 
it is only when frequencies of the order po/h are 
important in this contracted field that the dis- 
integration will be probable. In the whole of the 
calculation we shall confine ourselves to the case 
where the field is strongly contracted, where, 
therefore, the proton has a velocity, v, very close 
to that of light, and an energy large compared to 
its rest energy. We shall keep only the dominant 
terms in £ and In &, where €=1/(1—v?/c?)?, 

One way which suggests itself for this calcula- 
tion is the impact parameter method of v. 
Weizsacker and Williams,’ which replaces the 
contracted Coulomb field by a bundle of parallel 
y-rays moving in the same direction as the 
nucleus. This method is valid if the momentum 


Neglecting terms of order 1/é, we find 


1041 


of the field normal to the direction of motion of 
the nucleus can be neglected compared to the 
transverse momenta of the wave packet repre- 
senting the positron. As we shall see, in our 
problem values of the impact parameter for 
which this condition is not satisfied give an 
essential contribution to the cross section. 

Instead, we shall make a Fourier analysis of 
the Coulomb field of the passing nucleus, without 
neglecting the transverse component of the 
propagation vector of the electromagnetic field. 
The field of a point charge Ze moving with 
velocity v in the z direction is given by 


g=Le/(P+(e+y")/P I, 
A,=(u/c)e, A,=A,=0. 


e=A,= (Ze/2athe) { (RK) exp [ (¢/hce)(K-r—kct) | dK, ¢(K)=1/(g?+ k?/&), 


where the vector k is the component of K parallel to the zg axis, and g is the component of K per- 
pendicular to the g axis. By adding the gauge terms y’(K) = — ¢(K), A’(K) = — (K/k)¢(K) we ob- 


tain g=0 and 


A= { ACK) exp [ (4/hc)(K-r—kct) |dK/(2rhc)®, A(K)= —4rh?c?Ze(g/k)/(g2?+k2/#). (11) 


The matrix element of the interaction energy, H=e(q@- A), of an electron and the electromagnetic 
field (11), between a state of momentum p’/c and a negative energy state of momentum —p/c, is 


Hyp = —4nVPOL?0(g/k) (u!*agu) /(g?+k?/E), 


(12) 


where p’+p=K, and where we write s, for the component of a vector s in the direction of g. 
For the transition from the initial state (proton with momentum P=0) to the final state (neutron 


+ positron-++neutrino with respective momenta N, p/c, q/c) through an intermediate state in which 
the electron has a momentum p’/c, we obtain from (3) and (12), with the neglect of the kinetic 
energy of the heavy particle, the differential cross section

® The two other processes, (1) the proton is first scattered by the nucleus into an intermediate state and then emits 
the light particles and (2) a @-transformation of the nucleus is induced by the Coulomb field of the passing

The determining factors in (14) are the amplitude function f, which we assume to be large only for

From (15) and (16) we see that the principal 
contribution comes from values of g small com-

by retaining only the lowest power in g.

In carrying out the integrations over and gq we may again in the argument of the logarithm put 
pb~qw~gk, and set k~Ro=2qo, where qo is the value of g at the maximum of g|f(q, g)|?. The dominant 
terms in the cross section are

Wecan also calculate, from (14), the energy distribution of the emitted positrons in the coordinate 
system in which the nucleus is at rest. If in the coordinate system in which the proton is initially at 
rest the positron is moving at an angle 6 to the z axis, with energy e and velocity u, it has in the rest 
system of the nucleus the energy 

E=&e[1—(uv/c?) cos 6|~ép(1—cos 6) = Epx. 
The energy distribution is obtained by introducing £ as a new variable in place of x in (14), and 
reversing the order of integrations, leaving the integration over £ till last. The cross section for 


emission of a positron in the energy range dE at E is thus

For E> ko the distribution falls off rapidly with

For the total energy transmitted to the posi- 
trons per cm path, we obtain

where N is the number of atoms per cm’. 


2 In calculating the high energy tail it is not legitimate 
to replace f(p’, g) by f(g, q). With the amplitude function 
(7), the cross section for high energies falls off exponentially.

The angular distribution of the neutrinos in the 
rest system of the proton will be uniform for any 
amplitude function which does not contain a 
constraint between the direction of emission of 
the positron and neutrino. The energy lost to 
neutrinos per cm path is thus 


W,= NG, 
-| Ifa @) |?da/ f alf(q, q) |2dq. (24) 


This is larger than W., because the positrons are 


ejected preferentially in the forward direction in 


the rest system of the proton, and therefore re- 
ceive less energy. It is evident that the intro- 
duction of a constraint between the directions of 
the positron and neutrino could reduce W, toa 
value comparable to W.. 


4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Our final results for the cross section, energy 
distribution and energy losses for proton dis- 
integration are contained in the expressions (21) 
to (24). We have now to evaluate ¢o, using the 
amplitude functions f(p, gq) discussed in §2.

for A<o, with the help of (10). With the cor- 
respondence A~ko/(2s)?, (26) gives practically 
the same results as (25). We see from (25) and 
(26) that the cross section does not depend sensi- 
tively on the details of the amplitude function. 

The cross section is of the order of magnitude 
2nre?(Z?/137)(m/M) In? — and is therefore small 
even for large Z. As the main contribution 
comes from impact parameters of the order 
p=thc/ky~ séro the probability of a disintegra- 
tion for a single passage is very small, which is a 
necessary condition for the applicability of the 
Born approximation. The energy given to light 
particles per impact is, however, quite large, the 
mean energy lost to the positron being ~foé/In &, 
or about 3 billion volts for a 10 billion volt 
proton. 

To obtain an idea of the total energy trans- 
mitted to the light particles, we compare (23) and 
(24) with the ordinary ionization losses which are 
given by 


Wion = 24 NZroeme in (2&3 m?ct/Ry*Z?), 


where Ry=27 ev.

In Table I we give numerical values for the 
energies transmitted to positrons and neutrinos, 
and the loss by ionization, for a number of differ- 
ent energies in air (expressed in water equivalent) 
and in lead. The figures given are for s=4, n=2, 
but depend little on the particular values chosen. 

We have already mentioned that the model 
which we have assumed for the Fermi coupling 
precludes its importance for cosmic ray showers. 
If, however, it be supposed that heavy particles 
constitute an essential part of the penetrating 
component of cosmic rays, then the proton (and 
neutron) disintegrations considered in this paper 
can provide a mechanism for transferring a con- 
siderable fraction of the proton’s energy to a light 
particle, and thus for initiating showers at depths 
in-matter to which no electrons or photons can 
penetrate. For in most of these disintegrations 
the positron will have a high enough energy to 
initiate a small shower." In order to compare the 
effectiveness of these disintegrations with that of 
the energy transfer by direct impact with extra- 
nuclear electrons, we give in column 4 the energy 
lost per cm by such impacts to electrons of energy 
greater than 100 Mev. 

In the last column of Table I we give the mean 
distance traveled by a proton per disintegration. 
This distance is of the right order of magnitude to 
account for the observed incidence of showers 
under great thicknesses (>10 cm) of Pb. 


13 A discussion of shower production by high energy 
electrons has been given by J. F. Carlson and J. R. Oppen- 
heimer, Phys. Rev. 51, 220 (1937) and by H. T. Bhabha 
and W. Heitler, Proc. Roy. Soc. A159, 432 (1937).
