TWO NOTES ON THE PROBABILITY OF RADIATIVE 
TRANSITIONS

(Received March 4, 1930) 


ABSTRACT 


In 1 we compute the rate at which electrons and protons should, on Dirac’s 
theory of electrons and protons, annihilate each other; this gives a mean life time 
for matter of the order of 107!° sec. 


In 2 we compute by Dirac’s radiation theory the relative probability of radiative 
and radiationless transitions; we obtain an expression substantially equivalent to 
that derived by Heisenberg and Pauli. 


I 


N ELECTRON satisfying Dirac’s linear wave equation will very rapidly 
lose energy to the electromagnetic field. If the electron is free, it must 
lose this energy by radiating at least two quanta, in order that energy and 
momentum may be conserved in the process. If the electron is bound, e.g. 
in an atom, transitions in which only one quantum is radiated can occur, 
since there are then other particles present which can take up the necessary 
momentum. But these transitions are rare compared with the two-quantum 
transitions, which, as is well known, may be expected according to the theory 
to occur at an infinite rate. Now Dirac has suggested! that the reason why 
these transitions do not in fact occur is that the states of negative energy are 
filled; and this suggestion leads to a satisfactory understanding of the validity 
of the scattering laws derived from his wave equation. But according to Dirac 
not all of the states of negative energy are full; there are a few gaps in the dis- 
tribution for negative electrons nearly at rest; and thus transitions to states 
of negative energy should not be quite excluded. Dirac further suggests that 
the empty states of negative energy are protons; and thus the filling of these 
states should correspond to the annihilation of an electron and a proton. This 
should occur very rarely; and if Dirac’s suggestion were correct, we should 
expect to find a very small value for the corresponding transition probability. 
In this note we shall compute this transition probability on the basis of the 
present theory. 

This computation cannot be made theoretically unique and certain until 
the grave difficulties introduced by the inequality of electron and proton 
masses are resolved; and this resolution seems to demand an essential ad- 
vance? in the theory. The chief ambiguity for the present work arises from the 
fact that the energy radiated by the conversion of a stationary positive elec-

tron into a stationary negative electron is 2 mc’; whereas the energy liberated 
by the annihilation of a stationary electron and a stationary proton should be 
(m+ Mp)c?. We shall make the computation without explicit recognition of 
the difference in mass of electron and proton; this gives a transition probabil- 
ity which is absurdly large, and which is not appreciably reduced by the sub- 
stitution of m+ M> for 2m in the final formula. 

Let us consider for definiteness an enclosure of volume V in which there is 
one free electron, and one gap in the negative energy distribution; and let 
both the electron and the gap be at rest. If electron and proton have in fact a 
relative velocity v, then our result will be in error by terms of the relative 
order (u/c). For the wave equation of the electron we write 


|W /c + ame + (h/277) [a1(d/dx) + a2(d/dy) + a(d/d2]}y = 0 (1)

The two wave functions for a and 8 give electrons with spin oriented parallel

For the initial state of the electron we take 

W = Eq = hig = mo*, Yi? = oo? = 0; Wa? = eP*(2V)“1s a? = (2V)—1? (5) 
similarly for the final state we take 

W = EF? = — ly = —me*?; 3° = pat = 0; 

vit = ert (2V)-10; Yat = (20), 


Here y and 6 are independent indeterminate phases; if in the final results we 
average over these, we shall have assumed random orientations for the spins 
of both initial and final states; and with this understanding both (5) and (6) 
may be regarded as spherically symmetric. 

We shall need also the wave functions for states with

Initially there is to be no radiation present; the electron is in the state 
(0). The probability amplitude at a later time ¢ that a quantum of frequency 
vy, momentum p, and electric vector polarized along the unit vector e, shall 
have been emitted, and that the electron shall have jumped to a state of 
momentum P, energy #7, and polarization of spin 7 =a, 8, is then

The probability amplitude that the electron should have jumped to state 
(e), and that a second quantum of frequency v’, momentum p’, and polariza- 
tion along e’ should have been emitted, vanishes except when p’ = — p=P, and 
for p’=P has the value

This grows large only for y~vo, J7~ +(2)"v9; and here the first term in the 
bracket may be neglected. 

To evaluate >© for vy =v, 7= +(2)'?y9, we may without loss of generality 
take p along 2, since both initial and final wave functions are effectively 
spherically symmetric. We may further take, again without loss of generality, 
e along x. There are then two cases to consider, with e’ along x and along y 
respectively. For these cases we have in turn

From this we conclude that the probability of an emission is proportional to 
the square of the sine of the angle between the electric vectors of the two 
quanta. 

Now there are 2»,?(V/c’) components of the radiation field per unit solid 
angle per unit frequency about 9; the direction of propagation of one quan- 
tum can vary over a hemisphere; but when this is fixed polarization, fre- 
quency and direction of propagation of the other quantum are determinate. 
Thus we get the total chance of an emission at time ¢ by integrating the 
absolute value of the square of @ (averaged over y and 6) over a hemisphere of 
solid angle and all frequencies, and multiplying by 2»,?(V/c?); thus

It should be observed that the retention of the terms for # = — 2!/2yy in the 


expression (11) for >°, may be justified by an argument similar to that used 
by Dirac to validate the scattering formulae. For although the electron can- 
not jump to this state of negative energy, because it is already filled, there is a 
double transition which gives just the same terms in >., and in which first a 
negative electron in the state (—2!/*v»9, P, r) jumps to a state near the state 
(0), and then the original positive electron jumps down from the state (0) to 
the state (—2!v9, P,7); in either transition either of the two quanta may 
be emitted. 

If we try to correct (13) to take account of the fact that the energy ra- 
diated should be (m+ Mp)c? and not 2mc’, we get in place of (14)

Both (14) and (15) give an absurdly short mean life time for matter. With 
np = 10% we get 


T~5X 10-8; T7S 5X 10-9. 


Of course the protons and electrons of matter are not in general free, nor 
uniformly distributed, nor at rest. But we should hardly expect their agglom- 
eration into nuclei, or even atoms, to reduce appreciably the mean transi- 
tion probability, since this would mean essentially an increase in the effective 
np to be used. In any case (14) or (15) should apply roughly to electrons and 
protons in a discharge tube. 


I] 


In their paper on the relativistic treatment of the interaction of radiation 
and matter, Heisenberg and Pauli point out that according to their theory the 
radiationless transitions of the quantum mechanics may always be expected 


944 J. R OPPENHEIMER 


to be accompanied by transitions which correspond to a change in the ma- 
terial system and the emission of at least one quantum of light.’ So, for exam- 
ple, in the Auger jumps, in the ionization of an atom in an electric field, in the 
capture of electrons by alpha-particles, and in the radioactive decay of nuclei, 
the energy of the liberated particles should show a certain diffuseness; and 
energy is only conserved by the emission of an appropriate continuous dis- 
tribution of light. Heisenberg and Pauli derive an expression for the prob- 
ability of such transitions involving radiation; they show that this probability 
is small, compared with that of the radiationless transitions, of the order 


e/he (v/c)’. 


They apply this result to the problem of radioactive disintegration, where the 
escape of the alpha and beta particles may be roughly schematized as a diffu- 
sion through a high wall of potential energy; and they obtain so an explana- 
tion of the sharp definition of the energies of alpha-particles, and the great 
diffuseness of the beta spectrum. The non-appearance of the gamma radia- 
tion, which, on this theory, should accompany beta-ray disintegration, re- 
mains unexplained. 

In this note we shall compute the relative probability of such radiative 
transitions on the basis of the Dirac radiation theory. For this probability we 
obtain an expression which, in the approximation to which the calculations of 
H. P. were carried, should agree with the results of that calculation. In our 
formula certain terms appear which were deliberately neglected in H. P.; 
and further this formula is applicable to a slightly more general group of 
problems than that of H. P., which cannot strictly be applied to any of the 
problems mentioned above except that of the Auger jumps; but except for 
these minor modifications our result reduces to that of H. P.; and it gives the 
same predictions when applied to the theory of radioactive disintegration. 
The present work is rather simpler than that on the basis of the more general 
theory. 

For the occurrence of radiationless transitions it is essential that the 
material system (and we shall call this the “atom”) be in a quasistationary 
state of an energy equal to the energy of some aperiodic motion of the system. 
Let the wave equation for the atom,—which may be written in the configura- 


tion space, and without explicit reference to the radiation field, to the order 
(v/c)’—be 


(H — hv)y, = 0. (16) 
Let the initial state have the energy 
Eo = hv (17) 
and be given by a wave packet which satisfies the equation 
(H — V — hyo)o = O. (18) 


3 'W. Heisenberg and W., Pauli, Zeits. f. Physik 56, 1 (1929); cited as H. P. 


RADIATIVE TRANSITIONS 945 


The wave packets for the quasistationary aperiodic states of the atom we call 
6,; they satisfy 


(H — V’ — hv)é, = 0; £ = bv (19) 


and shall be normalized to dy. Then the probability of a radiationless transi- 
tion to the continuum is given, to the first order in the small quantity 


No/ Vo, by 


No = 4a? /h? | Vio | oe Vie = J 475,70. (20) 


(The integral over dr is to be taken over the configuration space of the atom.) 

Now let there be no radiation present initially. Since the atom has energy 
levels lower than Eo, it can make radiative transitions to these states; Dirac’s 
radiation theory gives us, for the probability per unit time per unit frequency 
v, of the radiation, for this transition 


Adv, = 167°, dv,/3hc? | P, +0 (2 
with 


Pek ve = f 479, Pee (21) 


where P is the time rate of change of the electric moment of the atom. (With 
Dirac’s linear Hamiltonian for the electron it will be 


> e,a* 
Rk 


where e, is the charge on the &’th particle, and the a‘s are the Dirac matrices, 
and the summation is to be taken over all particles.) 

Now when V is not very small, (21) gives us only a very poor approxima- 
tion for the probability of the corresponding transitions. Somewhat inac- 
curately we may say that the system can reach the same final state by a dou- 
ble jump, in which, e.g., the atom goes over into some arbitrary state in the 
continuum, and then—but there is no interval between the jumps,—jumps to 
the final state and emits a quantum. In this process of course only the total 
energy of the system is conserved, and that only when one considers the 
double jump as a single process. This is the effect treated by H. P.; and to 
obtain it we have only to carry the perturbation theory a step farther than 
was necessary for the derivation of (20) and (21). 

The Dirac wave equation for the probability amplitude @ for the whole 
system, taken as a function of the state, which for brevity we describe by the 
single index v, of the atom, and the number J,, of quanta of frequency »,, 
polarization p, and given direction of propagation, is

V’ in place of V. When yo and 6, are characteristic functions of the same 
equation, these terms reduce to those given in H. P. 

It should be observed that both (25) and H. P. (132) are derived as approxi- 
mations; in particular, the momentum of the light quantum, and terms of 
higher order in v/c, are neglected in both computations. The retention of this 
momentum leads to the same modification in (25) and H. P. (132); and so 
does the retention or terms of the fourth order in v/c. But in higher orders 
only the method of H. P. can be used, since then no equation of the form (16) 
holds for the atom, and it is necessary to work directly from the more general 
equations of quantum electrodynamics, and take more complete account of 
the retardation of the forces between the particles of the atom. 

To obtain the order of magnitude of the total radiative transition prob- 
ability for radioactive disintegrations, we may observe that V and V’ may 
be expected to be of the same order of magnitude as Avo, and we integrate (25) 
for all frequencies pv, up to v9; this gives

in agreement with H. P. (133). From (25) it is clear that only a much more 
detailed knowledge of 9, and WY» and of the form of the Hamiltonian Z in (16) 
than is at present available can give us any precise value for \,/Xo. 

The application of (27) enables us to estimate the relative probability of 
radiative and radiationless capture of electrons from atoms by an alpha par- 
ticle, and gives for the ratio of the probabilities 10-*, in agreement with the 
more detailed calculations of the effect.
