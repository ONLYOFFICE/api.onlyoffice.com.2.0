Note on Charge and Field Fluctuations 


J. R. OPPENHEIMER, Department of Physics, University of Calfornia 
(Received December 3, 1934) 


The field fluctuations which arise from the possibility of creating positron-electron pairs are 
computed. These fluctuations, which are inescapable in all field measurements, give a simple 
interpretation of Heisenberg’s results on charge fluctuations, and of the divergences which 
appear in his calculations. The pair-induced fluctuations in the radiation field are in general 
small of order a compared to those which arise from the corpuscular character of the radiation. 


HE fluctuations in charge density to be 
expected on the basis of the positron theory 
of Dirac have recently been studied by Heisen- 
berg.! Consider a large enclosure of volume JV, 
in which there are known to be WN; electrons of 
momentum k, and M; positrons of momentum k. 
Consider further a small volume of dimensions 
Iy, Le, L3, and ask for the average value of the 
charge in this volume over a time 7. This 1s, 
of course, with e the electronic charge,

é=e(m—7); 


The charge in this volume will, however, fluctu- 


ate about its mean value, and these fluctuations 


(Ae)? can now be divided, as Heisenberg has 
shown, into three sets of terms: 

(a) vacuum terms, which are present when 
‘N=M=0, and which have no analogue in 
non-relativistic theory. 

(8) terms linear in Nz, Mz. These reduce to 
their classically expected value 


(Ae)’= (i+) (1) 


for space time regions large compared to those 
within which the electrons and positfons can be 
localized. When, however, for all electrons and 
positrons present

(k; the component of momentum parallel to 
L;), then these fluctuations tend to vanish. The 
deviations from (1) under these circumstances 
are an immediate consequence of the limitations 
on the localizability of the particles.

(y) negative terms quadratic in the N’s and 
M’s, which give the familiar reduction, to be 
expected on the basis of the exclusion principle, 
in the fluctuations of a dense Fermi gas. 

It is with the vacuum terms that Heisenberg 
is chiefly concerned. These not only do not 
vanish, but for a sharply limited spatio temporal 
region are infinite. This result can only be 
interpreted as a consequence of the infinite 
disturbance produced when we try to measure 
the charge in a sharply defined region; and 
Heisenberg has, in fact, shown that if we take 
the boundaries of our spatial volume ‘spread 
out” over a distance 0, then we get in general 
finite fluctuations. Thus 


(Ae)?~eL?/bcT for cTK0KL; cTKA=hh/me. 
~OL/bCT? for cTKOKL; cT>>.. 


These conclusions lose at once their paradoxical 
character, if we consider the experimental ar- 
rangement by which we might measure the 
charge. To do this it is only necessary to measure 
the normal component of the electric field over 
the surface of the volume in which we are 
interested. These field measurements will give 


fluctuating results, and these fluctuations will 


correspond to those of the charge within the 
volume. We have thus to consider the fluctua- 
tions in the longitudinal component of the 
electric intensity, averaged over a time 7’, and 
a slab of dimensions 1, Le, Ls. | 

These field fluctuations are given by an 
integral of the form

The integrand differs from that given by 
Heisenberg for the charge fluctuations essentially 
by the factor |k—k’| -2. This integral converges, 
and may be evaluated when we make limiting 
assumptions about the relative magnitude of 
the lengths c7, L;, \. We thus find

If we apply these results to field measurements 
in a rectangular slab of area L*, and thickness 0, 
and use v (Ae)?~L?*v (A6&\)?, we get at once for 
the charge fluctuations the values (2) given by 
Heisenberg, and the further value, for the case

which is also in agreement with Heisenberg’s 
formulae. We thus see that the infinite fluctua- 
tions which we find for a sharply limited volume 
arise from the measurement of fields in infinitely 
thin slabs; for these an infinite charge density is 
required, and the charge fluctuations correspond 
to the pairs created in the neighborhood of 
these surface charges. 

The calculations of field fluctuations can Be 
extended to include those of the radiation field, 
which are of the same order of magnitude as 
those of the longitudinal field. Thus the fluctua- 
tions in the average value of the total electric 
intensity are given by an integral of the form 
(3), but with an extra factor 


(k—k’)2{ (kK—k’)2(ce’ — kk’ — p2) + (e+ e')2(ee’ +3k- k’+54")} 


(ce’ —k-k’— yw?) (e+e)? — (k— 


The corresponding integrals can again be 
evaluated under limiting assumptions about the 
magnitude of L, c7’, \ and lead to results whose 
order of magnitude agrees in every case with (4). 

These fluctuations in the radiation field are 
not in principle separable from the fluctuations 
arising from the corpuscular character of electro- 
magnetic radiation. These latter fluctuations 
have been studied by Bohr and Rosenfeld,? 
who give for them |

To these must be added the fluctuations arising 
from the creation of matter by the field measure- 
ments, so that the total fluctuations are, for 
instance, 


(Ace)?~hcL~(cT)? (1 +e? /hic) ; L«cT; L<&X. 
(Ac)??~whcL(cT)?(1+e/meL); L«&ceT; L>». 


From the form of these expressions it seems 
quite doubtful whether the physical significance 
of the modifications introduced by the pairs can 
be legitimately evaluated without taking into 
account the atomicity of the electric charge 
with which the field measurements are necessarily 
made.
