ABSTRACT 
From Pauli’s exclusion principle we derive the rule for the symmetry of the wave 
functions in the coordinates of the center of gravity of two similar stable clusters of 
electrons and protons, and justify the assumption that the clusters satisfy the Einstein- 
Bose or Fermi-Dirac statistics according to whether the number of particles in each 
cluster is even or odd. The rule is shown to become invalid only when the interaction 
between the clusters is large enough to disturb their internal motion. 


I. INTRODUCTION 


HE band spectra of symmetric diatomic molecules show certain striking 
differences from those of asymmetric molecules. For when the two nuclei 
of the molecule are identical, the intensity of the individual lines of a band, 
instead of varying smoothly from line to line, alternates more or less mark- 
edly. This alternation may in most cases be understood! with the help of a 
simple rule, but in the case of the N. molecule, the theoretical prediction 
seems to disagree with experiment, in that it leads us to expect those band- 
lines to be the niore intense, which are in fact weaker. In this paper we do not 
propose to resolve this disagreement; we shall only try to give as direct a der- 
ivation as possible of the rule which plays the cardinal part in obtaining the 
theoretical prediction. For it seems that, in spite of the frequent citations of 
this rule, no explicit derivation of it from Pauli’s exclusion principle has been 
published. In giving this derivation we shall have to investigate the condi- 
tions under which the rule is valid, and the degree of approximation to which 
it may be expected to hold. 
The rule may be stated: 


R. “If we have two nuclei, each built up of ~ electrons and m protons, and 
if the nuclei are in the “same inner state,” then not all the molecular states 
which would be possible for an asymmetric molecule will be found to occur; 
even, S 
if n+m is only those states will occur for which the wave function 
odd, U 
remains unchanged 
when we interchange the “coordinates” of the nuclei.

When the nuclei are in different states, the molecule behaves like an asym- 
metric molecule.” 

Since we may expect the nuclei to be in their normal state, we should be 
able by this rule to predict the weight of the states S and the weight of the 
states A if we knew the degree of degeneracy g of the normal states of the 
nuclei. Thus there will always be $¢(g—1) states S and $¢(g—1) states A pos- 
sible; if 2 plus m is even, there will be g states S, if 2 plus m is odd, gstates A, 
also possible. The relative weights of the states S and A will therefore be 


(g + 1)/(g — 1) if mn + mis even 
(g — 1)/(g +1) if m + mis odd. 


If we ascribe the degeneracy of the normal state of the nuclei to the spatial 
degeneracy of an angular momentum sh/27, then these ratios become 


(s + 1)/s for m + m even 
s/(s + 1) for m + m odd. 


(1) 


From this we see that, since ~-++m is odd for the nitrogen nucleus, the 
states A should have a greater weight than the states S. According to the 
assertions of band spectroscopists, the electronic wave functions of the normal 
state of the Ne molecule are symmetric in the coordinates of the nuclei, and 
there is no resultant electronic angular momentum parallel to the molecular 
axis. If we accept these assertions, we are led to expect a greater weight for 
states of odd rotational quantum number than for those of even quantum 
number; and it is this expectation which is not confirmed by experiment. 

Our problem is now so to refine the expressions “internal state” and “in- 
terchange the coordinates of the nuclei” in our rule R, that we can derive the 
rule from the exclusion principle. 


II. WAVE PACKETS FOR A SYSTEM OF Two CLUSTERS 


We shall consider first the following preliminary problem: Suppose that 
we have a system containing 27 electrons and 2m protons. Suppose further 
that for any group of electrons and m protons we could write down a com- 
plete set of wave functions u; for the stationary states k; how then, using any 
two of these wave functions uw, and w;, can we build up a wave packet for the 
whole system which satisfies the exclusion principle for all the electrons and 
all the protons in the system? Only when the particles of the system do not 
interact at all will these wave packets represent the stationary states of the 
whole system; but with the help of these packets, by linear combination, we 
shall be able to build up wave functions which do represent stationary states 
for any interaction energy of the particles. The functions u may for instance 
represent states of a nucleus, or an atom, or a molecule, or even some aper- 
iodic motion of the ” plus m particles; for this preliminary problem we need 
to make no assumption about them; but we shall see later that only when the 
functions u represent very stable configurations: 1.e. very tight binding of the 
particles,—can we deduce any significant results; and so we shall call any 
group of z electrons and m electrons a cluster. 


STATISTICS OF NUCLEI 335 


Let the cartesian coordinates, referred to a fixed axis system, and the com- 
ponent of spin in a fixed direction, of the jth electron be x;; similarly let the 
coordinates and spin of the zth proton be y;. Let us split up each of the func- 
tions u into two functions, a function 7, which depends only on the coordi- 
nates of the center of gravity of the cluster, and a function y, which depends 
on the relative coordinates of the particles, and on the spin variables:

We write a for the arguments (30149 - + + Xn, Vide > + Ym) and 8 for the argu- 
ments (Xn41Xn42° + + Lony Vnsi Vm42° + + Vom) 


Since T depends only on the sum of the coordinates of the electrons, and the 
sum of the coordinates of the protons, and does not involve the spins at all, 
it must remain unchanged when we make an arbitrary permutation of the 
arguments x of u among themselves or of the arguments y of u among them- 
selves. On the other hand uw must be antisymmetric in its arguments x and 
in its arguments y, since otherwise it could not represent a stationary state 
for the cluster allowed by the exclusion principle. Thus Y must be antisym- 
metric in the x’s and in the y’s. Let now P be an operator which makes an 
arbitrary permutation of the x’s and an arbitrary permutation of the y’s in 
any function of x1 +--+ Xen) ¥1 °° * Yen, and let p be the order of the permuta- 
tion P. Then the functions

satisfy the exclusion principle, if the summation be taken over all the (27)! 
(2m)! permutations P. There are only r=(2m)!(2n)!/(m!)2(n!)?. different 
terms in this sum, since by the antisymmetry of the y’s, all of the terms in 
which the arguments of 7, (and therefore also of T;) are the same have Jer 
ae same value. If we define a distribution by the symbol (x; ---, y;- .| 
-Yqg-++) in which the arguments of 7, are to the left, those of r, to 
ce ene of the line, and in which the order of the arguments to the left and 

to the right is indifferent, then we can write

Peter = — Di(—)*P{ Ta) Ti B¥e(oe(B) } (3) 


where now the summation is taken only over the 7 different distributions. 
Now in Fet.¢¢ with o =7T, we can combine the term with the distribution

This second term may be derived from (4) by 2 plus m interchanges, and will 
therefore appear in the sum with the same sign as (4) if.” plus m is even, and 


with the opposite sign if m plus 2 is odd. We may therefore write, with §=

where now the summation is taken over the 7/2 different sets of arguments in 
the y,’s. When 7o, we have instead,

Fite = — Dy (—) PP vo(a)ve(8)Ts(a) TB) + Oba(B)ve(ae) Ts(8) Ts(ax) } 


which we may write

symmetric ( even, 
From (5) we see that Fst,¢¢ is in s and ¢ when m-n is: 
antisymmetric lodd, 


and, from (6), that for r#0, Fst,o, has, for n-++m either even or odd, both a 
symmetric and an antisymmetric part, neither of which vanishes identically. 
These properties of the wave packets F will make it possible to deduce our 
rule. | 


III. SYMMETRY OF WAVE FUNCTIONS FOR A SYSTEM OF Two CLUSTERS 


We should expect that these symmetry properties in s and ¢ would persist 
in the stationary wave functions built up from the F’s whenever the interac- 
tion of the two clusters was too small appreciably to distort the internal con- 
figuration of the clusters. In this paragraph we shall have to find the wave 
functions @ for the stationary states of the system of two clusters. We shall 
see that, when certain matrix components of the interaction energy of the 
particles may be neglected, the ¢’s do in fact have the same symmetry in s, 
t as the corresponding wave packets F; and we shall see further that the con- 
ditions under which we may neglect these matrix components are just those 
in which the interaction of the clusters does not greatly disturb their internal 
motion. 

Let E be the energy of the system, and H the Hamiltonian; it will in gen- 
eral be given us as an operator on a function of the x’s and the y’s, and it will 
be ‘impartial’ to all «’s and ‘impartial’ to all y’s. The wave equation for 
b(x1 as Yom) will be 


(H — E)¢ =0 (7) 


Since ¢ must satisfy the exclusion principle, and since our original w’s formed 
a complete set of functions, we may expand ¢ as a linear function of the F's:

Here the summation >)” is to be taken over all pairs (¢,7) with or, and 


> @,t) over all pairs (s, t). We now introduce that part of the irreducible matrix 
for H which belongs to the term system satisfying the exclusion principle: 


(st, or | H| St o'r’) = J dV Pyt orl gv o'r. (9) 


The integration (dV ---) is to be taken over the whole domain of all the 
coordinates, and is to include a summation over the two values of all the 
spin variables. With the help of this matrix we may write the wave equation 
for the a’s which is equivalent to (8):

By (5), (6) we have

and | 
a(st, or) = Oa(ts, Tc). | (11) 


Suppose now that we may set 


(st, or | H| s't', o'r’) 


Mer Gaia (12) 


We shall have later to see under what circumstances, and to what approxima- 
tion, (12) is legitimate; but if we accept it, then we see that (10) reduces to a 
series of independent equations, one for each pair of values of (¢, T) 


o=T: > (a0, st | H| ao, st)alac, si) = Ealoo, s’t’) 
(s ,é) ; 


gr: >, > (or, s/t’ | H | oT, st)a(or, st) = Eator, s’t’) 
& t 


For each such pair of values (c, 7) we thus get a set of solutionsa (st); for o 
( symmetric \ even; 
=7 these will be: ins and t when m+ 7 is for o#r both 
lerieomneete load : 
symmetric and antisymmetric functions are possible. If we define the “state” 
of the cluster by the o’s, then this result is fully equivalent to the rule (X) 
given at the beginning of this paper. We may see this directly in the follow- 
ing way: for the quantum numbers s, ¢, we may take directly the value of the 
components of the total momenta of the two clusters; if we introduce the 


center of gravity coordinates of the two clusters, X, Y by the conditions 
sX — Xs = h/2wi; sY — Vs = 0; 


(13) 
WY — Vi = h/2wi; iX — X= 0; 


338 P. EHRENFEST AND J. R. OPPENHEIMER 


then we get the transformation functions: 
(st/XY) xz eT eri/h(sX+tY) | (14): 


The wave functions for the stationary states of the whole system are then 
given as functions of X, Y by 


Y_a(st, or)(st/XY). (15) 
s,t 
: symmetric even; 
For o =7, these must be: in X and Y when +m is for 
lene eae odd; 


o #7 they may have either symmetry. 

We have now only to consider the conditions for the validity of (12). If 
the states o, 7 of the isolated clusters are degenerate, then the matrix ele- 
ments of H corresponding to transitions between such degenerate states— 
states in which the isolated clusters have the same internal energy,—may be 
made to vanish by choosing suitably the u’s which give the stationary states 
of the clusters. The terms 


(st, ot | H | s't’, o’t’) 


in which the states (o, 7) and (o’, r’) correspond to different energy levels of 
the clusters, will, since the original “’s were chosen to make the internal en- 
ergy of the isolated clusters a diagonal matrix, represent the matrix compon- 
ents of the interaction and interchange energy of the particles in one cluster 
with those in the other; and if the particles in the cluster are very tightly 
bound together, these energies will be very small compared to the energy differ- 
ences of two stationary states a, o’ of the isolated cluster. The terms which 
were neglected in (12) therefore, will give in this case only very small correc- 
tion terms to the a’s of the order of the ratio of the interaction energy of the 
two clusters to their proper energy; in general these correction terms will 
be neither symmetric nor antisymmetric in s and ¢, so that only for very stable 
clusters may we expect a rule like (R) to hold: for the two identical atoms of 
a symmetric molecule no such rule as (R) holds, since here the interaction 
energy of the atoms is of the same order of magnitude as their proper energy. 
Even in this case, of course, the exclusion principle for the electrons and pro- 
tons reduces the number of possible stationary states; but here we cannot say 
just what states are excluded by investigating only the symmetry of the cor- 
responding wave functions in the coordinates of the center of gravity of the 
clusters, but must study in detail the symmetry of the functions in the coor- 
dinates of all the elementary particles. The importance of the rule (R) arises 
from the circumstance, that in the dynamical treatment of most atomic and 
molecular problems we do not need to know anything about the structure of 
the nuclei, except that they are stable: we may treat them as point charges, 
with, in some cases, a spin s which gives a proper intrinsic degeneracy. And 
whenever this is so, we may use a rule like (R) to determine what states of the 
system survive the exclusion principle.
