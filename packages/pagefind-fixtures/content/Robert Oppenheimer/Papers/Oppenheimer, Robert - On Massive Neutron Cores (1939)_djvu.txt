It has been suggested that, when the pressure within stellar matter becomes high enough, 
a new phase consisting of neutrons will be formed. In this paper we study the gravitational 
equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general 
relativity. For masses under $© only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately 
described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. 
For masses }O <m<2© two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more 
condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than ?© there are no static equilibrium solutions. 
These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases 
of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable effect 
of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the 
exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, 
although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium. 


I. INTRODUCTION 


OR the application of the methods commonly 
used in attacking the problem of stellar 
structure! the distribution of energy sources and 
their dependence on the physical conditions 


within the star must be known. Since at the time 


of Eddington’s original studies not much was 
known about the physical processes responsible 
for the generation of energy within a star, 
various mathematically convenient assumptions 
were made in regard to the energy sources, and 
these led to different star models (e.g. the 
Eddington model, the point source model, etc.). 
It was found that with a given equation of state 
for the stellar material many important properties 
of the solutions (such as the mass-luminosity 
-law) were quite insensitive to the choice of 
assumptions about the distribution of energy 
sources, but were common to a wide range of 
models. 

In 1932 Landau? proposed that instead of 
making arbitrary assumptions about energy 
sources chosen merely for mathematical con- 
venience, one should attack the problem by first 
investigating the physical nature of the equi- 
librium of a given mass of material in which no 
energy is generated, and from which there is no 
radiation, presumably in the hope that such an

investigation would afford some insight into the 
more general situation where the generation of 
energy is taken into account. Although such a 
model gives a good description of a white dwarf 
star in which most of the material is supposed to 
be in a degenerate state with a zero point energy 
high compared to thermal energies of even 10’ 
degrees, and such that the pressure is determined 
essentially by the density only and not by the 
temperature, still it would fail completely to 
describe a normal main sequence star, in which 
on the basis of the Eddington model the stellar 
material is nondegenerate, and the existence of 
energy sources and of the consequent temperature 
and pressure gradients plays an important part in 
determining the equilibrium conditions. The 
stability of a model in which the energy sources 
have to be taken into account is known to depend 
also on the temperature sensitivity of the energy 
sources and on the presence or absence of a 
time-lag in their response to temperature changes. 
However, if the view which seems plausible at 
present is adopted that the principal sources of 
stellar energy, at least in main sequence stars, are 
thermonuclear reactions, then the limiting case 
considered by Landau again becomes of interest 
in the discussion of what will eventually happen 
to a normal main sequence star after all the 
elements available for thermonuclear reactions 
are used up. Landau showed that for a model 
consisting of a cold degenerate Fermi gas there 
exist no stable equilibrium configurations for

masses greater than a certain critical mass, all 
larger masses tending to collapse. For a mixture 
of electrons and nuclei in which on the average 
there are two protonic masses per electron 
Landau found the critical mass to be roughly 
1.5©, and in general the critical mass is inversely 
proportional to the square of the mass per 
particle obtained by spreading out the total mass 
over only those particles which essentially de- 
termine the pressure of the Fermi gas. 

The possibility has been suggested’ that in 
sufficiently massive stars after all the thermo- 
nuclear sources of energy, at least for the central 
material of the star, have been exhausted a 
condensed neutron core would be formed. The 
minimum mass for which such a core would be 
stable has been estimated by Oppenheimer and 
Serber,* who on taking into account some effects 
of nuclear forces give approximately 0.1© asa 
reasonable minimum mass. The gradual growth 
of such a core with the accompanying liberation 
of gravitational energy is suggested by Landau as 
a possible source of stellar energy. 

In this connection it seems of interest to ask 
whether this mcdel of the final state of a star can 
be right for arbitrarily heavy stars, i.e., to 
investigate whether there is an upper limit to the 
possible size of such a neutron core. Landau’s 
original result for a cold relativistically degenerate 
Fermi gas quoted above gives in the case of a 
neutron gas an upper limit of about 6© beyond 
which the core would not be stable but would 
tend to collapse. Two objections might be raised 
against this result. One is that it was obtained on 
the basis of Newtonian gravitational theory while 
for such high masses and densities general 
relativistic effects must be considered. The other 
one is that the Fermi gas was assumed to be 
relativistically degenerate throughout the whole 
core, while it might be expected that on the one 
hand, because of the large mass of the neutron, 
the nonrelativistically degenerate equation of 
state might be more appropriate over the greater 
part of the core, and on the other hand the 
gravitational effect of the kinetic energy of the 
neutrons could not be neglected. The present

investigation seeks to establish what differences 
are introduced into the result if general relativistic 
gravitational theory is used instead of Newtonian, 
and if a more exact equation of state is used. A 
discussion of the general relativistic treatment of 
the equilibrium of spherically symmetric distri- 
butions of matter is first given, and then the 
special ideal case of a cold neutron gas is treated. 
A discussion of the results, and comparison with 
some results of Professor R. C. Tolman reported 
in an accompanying paper are given in the 
concluding sections. 


II. RELATIVIsTIC TREATMENT OF EQUILIBRIUM 


It is known‘ that the most general static line 
element exhibiting spherical symmetry may be 
expressed in the form 


ds?*= —@dr?—77d0?—7? sin? 6d¢?+e'dt?, 


hA=X(7), v=vr(r). 


If the matter supports no transverse stresses and 
has no mass motion, then its energy momentum 
tensor is given by 


Ti=TY=T3=—p, Ty=p (2) 


where p and p are respectively the pressure and 
the macroscopic energy density measured in 
proper coordinates. With these expressions for 
the line element and for the energy momentum 
tensor, and with the cosmological constant A 
taken equal to zero, Einstein’s field equations 
reduce to:?

termine the mechanical equilibrium of the matter 
distribution as well as the dependence of the 
uy S ON Ff. 

The boundary of the matter distribution is the 
value of r=”, for which p=0, and such that for 
r<m, p>O. For r<7 the solution depends on the 
equation of state of the material connecting p 
and p. For many equations of state a sharp 
boundary exists with a finite value of 7. 

In empty space surrounding the spherically 
symmetric distribution of matter p=p=0, and 
Schwarzschild’s exterior solution is obtained :8 


erXO=1+A/r, eM=BA+A/r). (6) 


The constants A and B are fixed by the require- 
ment that at great distances away from the 
*matter distribution the g,,’s must go over into 
their weak-field form, i.e. B=1, A =—2m where 
m is the total Newtonian mass of the matter as 
calculated by a distant observer.® 

Inside the boundary Eqs. (3), (4) and (5) may 
be rewritten as follows. Using the equation of 
state p=p(p) Eq. (5) may be immediately

R. OPPENHEIMER AND G. M. VOLKOFF 


Equations (9) and (10) form a system of two 
first-order equations in uw and »p. Starting with 
some initial values u=uo p= pp at r=0, the two 
equations are integrated simultaneously to the 
value r=7, where p=0, i.e., until the boundary 
of the matter distribution is reached. The value 
of u4=uy at y=7, determines the value of e) at 
the boundary, and this is joined continuously 
across the boundary to the exterior solution, 
making 


ro rp 2m 
uw=—L[1 —evny= — (3 -—)| =m. 
2 2 Yo 


Thus the mass of this spherical distribution of 
matter as measured by a distant observer is 
given by the value uw» of u at r=75. 

The following restrictions must be made on the 
choice of #p and uo, the initial values of p and u 
at r=0: 

(a) In accordance with its physical meaning as 
pressure, Po=0. 

(b) From Eq. (8) it is seen that for all finite 
values of e-, uw)»=0. Since gi;= —e* must never 
be positive, #20 for infinite values of e~ at the 
origin. However, it may be shown that of all the 
finite values of po at the origin p)=0 is the only 
one compatible with a negative value of uw, and 
that for equations of state of the type occurring 
in this problem even this possibility is excluded, 
so that uw) must vanish.!° 

(c) A special investigation for any particular 
equation of state must be made to see whether 
solutions exist in which OZ=u,=—o and p-o 
as r—>0. 


III. PARTICULAR EQUATIONS OF STATE 


The above arguments show that Eqs. (9) and 
(10) together with a given equation of state 
completely determine the distribution of matter. 


10 This can be seen from the following argument. Having 
chosen some particular value of pp one may usually repre- 
sent the equation of state in that pressure range by p=Kp* 
with some appropriate value of s. Using this equation of 
state and taking the approximate form of Eq. (10) near 
the origin for the case uo <0, and finite o, one obtains: 


eee SS eee 


dr 2r 2r 


Integration of this equation shows that for s<1 po=0 can 
not be satisfied, and for s=1 only the value po=0 is 
possible. For the equations of state used in this problem 
always s<1 holds. It may also be noted that the above 
equation together with Eq. (7) show that e’—> o as r—0. 


MASSIVE NEUTRON CORES 


The assumption p=const., “u»=0 makes it pos- 
sible to integrate Eqs. (9) and (10) explicitly 
and leads to Schwarzschild’s interior solution." 
Other matter distributions corresponding to 
other equations of state are given by Professor 
Tolman in an accompanying paper. 

If the matter is taken to consist of particles of 
rest mass up obeying Fermi statistics, and their 
thermal energy” and all forces between them are 
neglected, then it may be shown that a para- 
metric form for the equation of state is: 


p=K(sinh t—2), (11) 

= }K(sinh ¢—8 sinh 3/+ 32), (12) 
where K=-potc®/4h3 (13) 
and i=4 log (2 +[1+(— £3) | ) (14) 
| Moe Moe 


where # is the maximum momentum in the 
Fermi distribution and is related to the proper 
particle density N/V by 


—=—?. (15)

into Eqs. (9) and (10) one gets:

11R, C. Tolman, reference 5, pp. 246-247. 

2 The condition for thermal equilibrium in a static 
gravitational field is given by Tolman (reference 5, p. 318) 
as To(g44)t =const. where 79 1s the proper temperature. The 
equilibrium state of a matter distribution which no longer 
radiates appreciably corresponds to a low surface tempera- 
ture To. If ga, is everywhere finite, then JT» will be small 
throughout the matter distribution. For those singular 
solutions in which gq, vanishes at the origin it is conceivable 
that the central temperature may be high. However, on 
the one hand from Eq. (7) it is seen that the vanishing of gas 
at the origin corresponds to infinite central pressure, and in 
this limit the equation of state given below reduces to 
p=3p so that temperature introduces no radically new 
effects, and on the other hand zero values of ga, indicate 
the slowing down of all physical processes near the origin 
and thus may correspond to nonstatic solutions describing 
states which have not yet attained equilibrium, and which 
are not discussed in this paper.

These equations are to be integrated from the 
values u=0, f=t) at r=0 to r=7 where 4=0 
(which makes p=0), and u=w. 

A note must be made of the units employed 
in these equations. Eqs. (3), (4) and (5) from 
which (16) and (17) are derived are stated in 
relativistic units,!4 i.e., such that c=1, G=1 (cis 
the velocity of light, G is the gravitational 
constant). This determines the unit of time and 
the unit of mass in terms of a still arbitrary unit 
of length. The unit of length is now fixed by the 
requirement that K=1/4. Eqs. (16) and (17) 
now become: 


u

r 
dt 4 sinh ¢—2 sinh 3t 
dr r(r—2u) cosh t—4 cosh 3+3 
< [4r3(sinh ¢+8 sinh 32+34)+u]. (19) 


The unit of length has been fixed to be

For a neutron gas a= 1.36 X 108 cm, 6=1.83 X 10%4 
g. The general character of the solution is seen 
to be independent of the mass of the neutron 
which determines only the scale of the result. 
No way was found to carry out the integration 
analytically, so Eqs. (18) and (19) were inte- 
grated numerically for several finite values of to. 
For all these cases “4 was taken to be equal to 
zero, since the equation of state near the origin 
for finite tg behaves like p(p)=Kp*, s<1. The 
first four entries in Table I were thus obtained. 
For tp > Eqs. (18) and (19) may be replaced 
by their asymptotic expressions:

An exact solution® of these equations is: 


et= 3/77", u= 37/14, (22) 


which corresponds to tp= ©, u=0. A careful 
examination of Eqs. (20) and (21) shows that 
there are no other solutions corresponding to 
to= 0, O=u9=— 0. The exact solution (22) of 
the approximate equations (20) and (21) was 
taken out to that value of + where t=6 (the 
approximation in the form of Eg. (20) and (21) 
it quite good for #26), and then the integration 
of the exact equations (18) and (19) was carried 
out numerically to r=”, where t=0. This gave 
the last entry in Table I. 

It is of interest to ask whether perhaps a 
finite gravitational mass might correspond to an 
infinite number of particles, and an infinite 
gravitational binding energy. It may be seen 
that this is not the case by the following argu- 
ment. Although the proper particle density 
becomes infinite when the central pressure be- 
comes infinite, still it remains integrable, so that 
the total number of particles always remains 
finite. The element of proper volume of a 
spherical shell is 47re*r*dr. As the solution of 
the approximate equations shows in the neigh- 
borhood of the origin:

AND G. M. VOLKOFF 


For very small values of ¢ the equation of 
state (11), (12) reduces to p=Kp®8 and fet. 
Using this equation of state and Newtonian 
gravitational theory (which is expected to give a 
good result for small masses and densities), one 
finds that f«<m?, or that m«#i, Fig. 1 gives a 
schematic plot of the dependence of m on fo for 
the case that the elementary particles are 
neutrons. The mass m is plotted in units of 
sun’s mass (2X10 ¢) against tan! fy. The curve 
near the origin is dotted since, as has been 
already pointed out, a neutron core with a mass 
less than about 0.1© will disintegrate into 
nuclei and electrons. 

The striking feature of the curve is that the 
mass increases with increasing fp) until a maxi- 
mum is reached at about t9)=3, after which the 
curve drops until a value roughly 4© is reached 
for fy= ©. In other words no static solutions at 
all exist for m>2©, two solutions exist for all m 
in 2© >m>40, and one solution exists for all 
m<ZO. 

Some insight into this situation may be gained 
from the following considerations. In the non- 
relativistic polytrope solutions of Emden!* the 
equation of state was assumed to be p=Kp’ 
= Kp't1/*, Solutions which at first sight seem to 
be quite satisfactory (i.e., giving a finite mass 
within a finite radius) were found for values of 
n<5ory>6/5. But Landau? pointed out that al- 
though these solutions in every case give an equi- 
librium configuration, they do not in every case 
give stable equilibrium. Thus, unless y=4/3 the 
equilibrium configuration is unstable. This may 
be seen from the following rough calculation. 
The gravitational part of the free energy of the 
system is negative and proportional to p? where

p is an appropriate average density (Newtonian 
gravitational theory is used). The part of the 
free energy caused by compression is propor- 
tional to f{pdv, and hence to p?— (y#1). Thus 


F=—ap'+bp7. 


Polytrope solutions exist for both y=5/3(>4/3), 
i.e., for n=3/2 and for y=5/4(<4/3, but 
>6/5), ie., for ~=4, but as may be seen from 
the schematic plot of the free energy curves in 
Fig. 2, the former corresponds to stable equi- 
librium and the latter to unstable equilibrium. 
In the present relativistic calculations the 
results for small masses and small central 
densities and pressures (small values of ¢o), as 
was already mentioned above, may be expected 
to agree quite closely with nonrelativistic calcu- 
lations with the equation of state p= Kp’. Since 
p is a monotonic function of #, the curves of free 
energy against ¢) for fixed total number of 
particles, and thus for a fixed Mo (gravitational 
mass at zero density; the gravitational mass will 
vary somewhat along a curve of constant 
particle number, as the density increases), will 
for small masses have the same general character 
as the curves of free energy against some average 
density in the nonrelativistic case (cf. the curve 
for y=5/3 in Fig. 2). Then as the number of 
particles is increased the character of the free 
energy curves must change in order to admit 
the possibility of a second equilibrium position. 
Since the free energy must be a continuous 
function of f, and since we know from non- 
relativistic calculations that for small masses 
(and low densities) we have a position of stable 
equilibrium (a minimum in the free energy 
curve) we can conclude that the second equi- 
librium position corresponds either to a maxi- 
mum or to an inflection point in the free energy 
curve (and certainly not to a minimum). Fig. 3 
gives a schematic plot of free energy against fp 
for different values of My which would explain 
the existence of one equilibrium position for 
small masses, two for intermediate masses, and 
none for large masses. The masses marked on 
the curves are the actual gravitational masses 
corresponding to the equilibrium points of the 
critical free energy curves separating the solu- 
tions into the three types mentioned above.

IV. DiscussIoN—-RELATION TO TOLMAN’S 
SOLUTIONS 


Before we study the physical implications of 
these results, we may try to show how their 
qualitative features may be obtained from the 
analytic solutions recently discovered by Pro- 
fessor Tolman.!’ This will also help us to under- 
stand the probable effect of alterations in the 
equation of state of the neutron gas at high 
densities. 

On the one hand Tolman’s solution IV, dis- 
cussed in §6 of his paper, enables us to under- 
stand the existence of a limiting mass for static 
solutions and to give an estimate of its magni- 
tude; on the other hand Tolman’s solution VI, 
discussed in §8 (and less directly solution V), has 
for #=4, very much the character of our singular 
solution for t—«, and, with appropriately 
chosen constants, gives a mass of the same 
order of magnitude as we have found. 

Tolman’s solution IV is nonsingular, and 
corresponds to the quadratic equation of state 
(6.5) of his paper:

(Tolman , 6.5), 


where p, and ~, are the central density and 
pressure. From Eqs. (6.4), (6.6) and (6.9) of 
Tolman’s paper the mass corresponding to this 
solution is given in terms of p, and p- by

pe COrresponding to this maximum the equation 
of state (Tolman 6.5) does not differ qualita- 
tively from the Fermi equation of state (11), 
(12), as may be seen by comparing for the two 
solutions the values of dIn p/dInp; and the 
maximum mass in fact turns out from’ (23) to 
be ~0.40, agreeing in order of magnitude with 
our value of ~0.70. 

Tolman’s solution V, with n=4, R-o, and 
his solution VI, with n=4, B/A-—0, are just our 
solution (22) corresponding to the equation of 
state p=4p, a unique unstable singular solution. 
For solution V, with ~=4 and finite R, the 
pressure differs from 3p by terms of the order of 
p~/8: however, for VI with n= and finite B/A, 
for large p, p—3p=const. p?, which is just the 
behavior of a highly compressed Fermi gas.

V. DiscussIon—-APPLICATION TO STELLAR 
MATTER 


We have seen that for a cold neutron core 
there are no static solutions, and thus no equi- 
librium, for core masses greater than m~0.7©. 
The corresponding maximum mass MM), before 
collapse is some ten percent greater than this. 
Since neutron cores can hardly be stable (with 
respect to formation of electrons and nuclei) for 
masses less than ~0.1©, and since, even after 
thermonuclear sources of energy are exhausted, 
they will not tend to form by collapse of ordinary 
matter for masses under 1.5© (Landau’s limit), 
it seems unlikely that static neutron cores can 
play any great part in stellar evolution; and 
the question of what happens, after energy 
sources are exhausted, to stars of mass greater 
than 1.5© still remains unanswered. It should 
be observed that for the critical solution with 
m~0.7© the potentials g,, are nowhere singular, 
and that in particular.such a core does not tend 
to “protect itself’ from the addition of further 
matter by the vanishing of gs, at the boundary. 
There would then seem to be only two answers 
possible to the question of the “final’’ behavior 
of very massive stars: either the equation of.

surrounding the core must be small for cores much more 
massive than the lightest core stable with respect to dis- 
integration into electrons and nuclei. . 


MASSIVE NEUTRON CORES 


state we have used so far fails to describe the 
behavior of highly condensed matter that the 
conclusions reached above are qualitatively mis- 
leading, or the star will continue to contract 
indefinitely, never reaching equilibrium. Both 
alternatives require serious consideration. 

The central density in the ‘‘critical’’ core is 
even higher than nuclear density, so that our 
extrapolation of the Fermi equation of state can 
hardly rest on a very sure basis. Under these 
conditions the disintegration of neutrons, either 
into protons and electrons, or into mesotrons, 
will be energetically unfavorable and will not 
occur. And the relatively weak attractive forces 
which are known to act between neutrons will 
facilitate, and not prevent, the collapse of the 
core. If, however, under extreme compression, 
phenomena occurred which have the effect of 
repulsive forces, i.e., of raising the pressure for a 
given density above the value given by the 
Fermi equation of state, this could tend to 
prevent the collapse. 

Such repulsive forces, even if they exist, will 
hardly make possible static solutions for arbi- 
trarily large amounts of matter. For at low 
densities they cannot appreciably affect the 
equation of state, so that the dimensions of the 
core will necessarily be finite, and so will be the 
gravitational mass m of the core 


m=iri—e-*) (Tolman, 5.5). 


Nor can the mass M) before collapse be infinite. 
For this to be true we should have to have a 
singular solution. But the effect of repulsive 
forces can for high density at most be to make 3p 
even more nearly equal to p than for the Fermi 
equation of state; and for p=3p, as has been 
remarked above, and as is also suggested by 
Tolman’s solutions V and VI, the only singular 
static solution is (22), for which the total 
particle number is finite. 

We may obtain an extreme limit on the in- 
crease in the limiting mass which strong repulsive 
forces at high densities could give, by the 
following simple argument. For p<10% g/cm! 
these forces can hardly be important. Let us 
assume that for p210"5, they have the extreme 


381 


effect of making p=4p. Then the mass of a 
sphere for which this equation of state holds 
down to p=105, and for which # falls rapidly as 
p— 0, is given by our solution (22), and is of the 
order of ©. It seems likely that our limit of 
~0.7© is near the truth. 

This argument is based on the requirement 
that even for arbitrarily high densities, p—3p 
shall not be negative; and this is in turn closely 
related to the positive definite character of the 
(proper) energy density of neutrons and of the 
fields of force (apart from gravitation) associated 
with them. It seems probable that if p could be 
very much greater than $p, static solutions of 
arbitrarily Jarge mass could be found.’® 

From this discussion it appears probable that 
for an understanding of the long time behavior 
of actual heavy stars a consideration of non- 
static solutions must be essential. Among all 
(spherical) nonstatic solutions one would hope 
to find some for which the rate of contraction, 
and in general the time variation, become slower 
and slower, so that these solutions might be 
regarded, not as equilibrium solutions, but as 
quasi-static. Some reason for this we may see 
in the following argument : for large enough mass 
the core will collapse; near the center the density 
and pressure will grow, and g4,=e” will be small 
(cf. Eq. (7)) ; and as e” grows smaller, all processes 
will, as seen by an outside observer, slow down 
in the central region. Formally one sees this, in 
the occurrence, in Einstein’s equations, of prod- 


ucts of the form

- justified to neglect even a very slow time varia- 


tion; and the singular solutions which pre- 
sumably represent very massive neutron cores 
cannot be obtained unless this is taken into 
account. These solutions are now being in- 


vestigated. 


19 Thus for p=const. there is a class of singular static 
solutions, for which p~&k/r?, and which would seem to lead,
