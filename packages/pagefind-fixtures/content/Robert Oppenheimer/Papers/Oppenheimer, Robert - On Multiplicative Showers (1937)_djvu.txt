In I we discuss the status of the quantum theoretic 
formulae for pair. production and radiation in the domain 
of cosmic-ray energies, and the relevance of these processes 
to an understanding of showers and bursts. In II we give 
a qualitative estimate of the course implied by the theory 
for a shower or burst built up by multiplication froma 
very energetic primary; we then set up the diffusion 
equations for the equilibrium of electrons and gamma-rays, 
and show how these can be simplified. In III we carry 
through the analytic solution of the diffusion equations,

N nuclear fields, gamma-rays produce pairs, 
and electrons lose energy by radiation. The 
formulae which have been deduced! from the 
quantum theory give for the probability of these 
processes values which, for sufficiently high 
energies, no longer depend upon the energy of the 
radiation. Because of this, the secondaries, pro- 
duced by a photon or electron of very high 
energy, will be nearly as penetrating as the 
primary, so that the primary energy will soon be 
divided over a large number of photons and 
electrons. It is this development and absorption 
of showers which we wish to investigate. 

The finite limiting cross sections for radiative 
loss and for pair production essentially limit the 
penetrating power of electrons and photons; as 
we shall see, 20 cm of Pb should absorb prac- 
tically all such radiation if the primary energies 
are <105 Mev. From this one can conclude, either 
that the theoretical estimates of the probability 
of these processes are inapplicable in the domain 
of cosmic-ray energies, or that the actual pene- 
tration of these rays has to be ascribed to the 
presence of a component other than electrons and 
photons. The second alternative is necessarily 
radical; for cloud chamber and counter experi- 
ments show that particles with the same charge 
as the negative electron belong to the penetrating 
component of the radiation; and if these are not

they are based may be found in Heitler’s book, The

and find the distribution of electrons and gamma-rays 
as a function of their energy, the primary energy, and the 
thickness and atomic number of the matter traversed. 
We treat the effect of ionization losses on the shower, 
calculate the amount of radiation of low energy to be 
expected, and treat transition effects in passing from one 
substance to another. In IV we discuss the results of the 
calculations, and give a summary of the conclusions to 
which they lead, and the difficulties. 


electrons, they are particles not previously known 
to physics.’ 

Direct evidence for the approximate vandiey 
of the theoretical formulae is provided by the 
latest studies of Anderson and Neddermeyer? on 
the energy loss and pair production of electrons of 
energy up to 400 Mev. This evidence is still 


incomplete; yet it affords absolutely no indica- 


tion of a breakdown of the theoretical formulae. 
Since there is good evidence from the altitude and 
latitude curves of cosmic-ray ionization, as well 
as from the transition curves for showers and 
bursts, of a component in the cosmic rays which 
is strongly absorbed and yet has a very high 
energy, it seems of interest to investigate in detail 
the consequences which the theoretical formulae 
imply for the degradation, multiplication and 
absorption of such radiation. We shall find in this 
way a model for the building up and absorption 
of large showers and bursts which in many 1mpor- 
tant respects agrees with what is found experi- 
mentally.4 From this we should like to derive on 
the one hand a further argument for the qualita- 
tive validity of the theoretical formulae, and on 
the other for the often repeated suggestion that 
many showers are built up by a long succession

rays were protons, positive and negative: E. J. Williams,

favor a particle of smaller mass.

ON MULTIPLICATIVE SHOWERS 


of simple elementary processes, and not by the 
simultaneous ejection of a huge number of par- 
ticles in one elementary act. 

Here a certain caution is necessary. Cloud 
chamber observations have shown the existence 
of two fairly well differentiated types of shower.® 
In one of these, and by far the more common, 
only electrons, positrons and y-rays appear to 
take part; the shower particles are, except for 
those of very low energy, well collimated, with 
transverse momenta of the order of a few million 
volts; the showers can often be seen to increase in 
passing through matter, and typically, if they are 
large, have no well-defined focus. It is these 
showers for which our calculations will give us 
some understanding. In the other and rarer type 
of shower, transverse momenta of the order of 
100 Mev are common; the shower is usually not 
collimated at all; heavy recoil particles are fre- 
quently seen ; and the total number of particles is 
usually small. It.is natural to ascribe these 
showers to the interaction of heavy and light 
particles, and to accept the arguments which 
Heisenberg® has advanced to show that for such 
processes the probability of ejection of several 
particles should be of the same order of magni- 
tude as that of one. It would seem, however, that 
Heisenberg’s attempt to interpret on this basis 
the larger showers and bursts as highly multiple 
elementary processes is without cogent experi- 
mental foundation; and we believe that in fact it 
rests on an abusive extension of the formalism of 
the theory of the electron neutrino field. 

One can then believe in the applicability of the 
following analysis to cosmic-ray photons and 
electrons and their showers, only if he admits the 
presence of another component to which the 
analysis is not at all applicable, and of other 
types of elementary processes, which essentially 
involve the heavy particles and their coupling 
with electrons, and which find no place in this 
treatment. 


I] 


We are interested then in what happens when 
an electron (or positron or photon) of very high 
initial energy passes through matter. We shall

consider only the three elementary processes of 
pair production by photons, radiation by elec- 
trons, and ionization losses by electrons, the first 
two because they dominate the multiplication 
which makes the shower, the third because it 
limits the size of the shower and absorbs it. We 
shall not consider relatively rare multiplicative 
processes, such as the production by electrons of 
high energy electronic secondaries, the direct 
production of pairs by electrons, or the Compton 
effect. We shall suppose that all high energy 
particles come off forward, and neglect the 
angular divergence of the shower. We shall not 
try to treat in detail radiation of such low energy 
that these simplifications are invalid. 

To define the probabilities of the elementary 
processes, we shall use simplified formulae which 
approximate closely to the limiting forms which . 
the theory gives for high energies.! 

Thus for the probability that an electron (or 
positron) radiate an energy in the range E, E+AE 
in passing through a thickness Ax of matter of 
atomic number Z, nuclear density N, we shall 
take |

E make a pair of energy EF’, E—E’, we take

It is convenient to measure length in terms of a 
variable t=xK. For Pb the unit of length is ~} 
cm, for water it is about 0.4 m. For elements as 
heavy as Pb, the constants K and K’ can hardly 
be regarded as known within 20 percent. Formula 
(1) is a good approximation as long as the elec- 
tronic energy is >20 Mev; formula (2) begins to 
give too large results for E<50 Mev, but is off by 
only a factor 2 at H=25 Mev. As for ionization 
losses, we shall suppose them to be independent 
of energy, and evaluate them for those energies, 


where their effect will be important. Thus we 


shall write for electrons

For Pb, 8 has the value 6.5 Mev. It is quite 
closely inversely proportional to Z. 

For primary energies which are not too high, 
one can carry through the calculations step by 
step, finding how many gamma-rays are pro- 
duced by the primary, how many of these are 
absorbed by pair production, how many gamma- 
rays these in turn produce. This procedure was 
used in computing the number of pairs theo- 
retically to be expected in the electron traversals 
studied by Anderson and Neddermeyer; it has 
been used by Nordheim, and by Heitler and 
Bhabha,’ though here with neglect of ionization 
losses. It clearly becomes prohibitively laborious 
for thicknesses and energies of the order of those 
involved in large showers and in bursts; and we 
shall try instead to solve the diffusion equations 
implied by (1), (2) and (3), and so obtain an 
insight into the course of the shower for large 
thicknesses and high primary energies. An ex- 
tremely rough indication of what we may expect 
to find we can see from a quite simple argument. 

Both radiation and pair production give two 
rays for one in the shower. Each process of this 
kind has about an even chance of happening in a 
distance t=1 (somewhat less than even for pair 
production, somewhat more for y-radiation). 
Thus the order of magnitude of the total number 
of electrons and y-rays to be expected at a 
thickness ¢ is 2'. The order of magnitude of the 
energy loss in thickness Aft is thus ~$82‘At. When 
the integral of this is equal to the primary 
energy Eo, the shower will be absorbed. Thus if 
Tis the distance to which the shower penetrates

From this it follows that 7 will increase log- 
arithmically with EK, and that it will decrease 
slowly with decreasing Z; that the number of 
particles in the shower will increase with Eo 
roughly linearly, and will be roughly proportional 
to Z. For showers of about 30 particles we should 


7 We are indebted to Dr. Nordheim for writing to us of 
his results. See also Heitler and Bhabha, Nature 138, 401 
(1936). We are further indebted to Heitler and Bhabha 
for sending us a manuscript of the paper in which they 
have extended these calculations. Their results differ from 
ours primarily because of their neglect of ionization losses; 
apart from this the agreement between their values and 
ours is excellent. We do not agree with their conclusion 
that these calculations make it possible to ascribe the 
greater part of sea-level cosmic radiation to degraded 
electrons and photons of high initial energy.

expect the maximum in the shower to come at 
T ~ —logs 30~5, or a little over two cm of Pb or 
about 7 cm of Fe. These are in fact! of the order 
of the distances at which maxima are found for 
the transition curves for relatively small showers. 
For bursts of 1000 particles the transition maxima 
are found® at about twice as great thicknesses, as 
our rough estimate would suggest. 

To set up our diffusion equations, let us write 
y(t, E)AE for the probable number of gamma- 
rays to be found at a thickness ¢ in the energy 
range EL, E+AE and Ot, E)AE for the cor- 
responding number of electrons and positrons.

and give the change in pair distribution which 
comes directly from the radiative losses of the 
charged particles. The term in 8 gives the cor- 
responding change from ionization losses, and the 
first term on the right in (6) gives the pair pro- 
duction by y-rays. In (5) the first term gives the 
absorption of y-rays by pair production, and the 
second term their replenishment by radiation.

It is not possible by differentiation to reduce — 


(6) to a differential equation, because of the 
occurrence of # in the integrand of (7). We have 
therefore tried to replace the terms (7) by others, 
which would lead to a readily soluble system of 
differential equations, and which would still give 
a good representation of (7). As we shall see, we 
can obtain a solution in terms of integrals of 
elementary functions provided we write in

The use of this form for R corresponds to assum- 
ing a uniform distribution of energy losses instead 
of the 1/E law given by (1), and renormalizing 
to give the correct total energy loss. The produc- 
tion of y-rays is, however, treated correctly in 
accordance with (1); it is only the effect of these 
losses on the redistribution of the electrons them- 
selves that is falsified. Since it is difficult to give 
an a priori estimate of the error thus introduced 
into the solution, we have used the solutions 
which we have obtained to compare the values of 
R given by (7) and by (11a). When ¢ is not too 
small, most of the particles have of course an 
energy E<E)>. For this case we found that the 
two values of R agreed within less than 5 percent. 
It is of some interest to ask why this should be. 

The answer is to be found in the circumstance 
that for EXE, our energy distribution curves 
for @ follow quite closely a 1/E? law as Fig. 4 
shows, and as cloud chamber observations sug- 
gest that they should. For this law 


P(t, Z)~k(t)/E? 
and for E<Ep, both (7) and (11a) agree in giving 
R= —k(i)/E’. 


The approximation of replacing (7) by (11a) is 
thus a very good approximation in the range 
where neither ¢ nor In E/E are too small; and we 
shall see that it is only here that our results are of 
direct physical interest, because for small ¢ and 
E~E, the fluctuations to be expected from the 
probable behaviors defined by @® and y are 
all-important. 

Using (11a) for R, and differentiating (6) we 
get, if we use (10), the differential equation for 2

and for R(y)>0, u>v. The constants M,, Ny, 
and the contour C must be chosen to satisfy (13). 
It is clear that the integrand of (14) will have 
branch points in the negative half y plane, and 
that it will -0 as |y|—o. We therefore choose 
for our contour C a closed path, consisting of a 
straight line 6—z0 to 6+20, and the infinite

Since F, and 0F,/dt—-0 as |y|— ©, and have no

be used in place of (9). But for the treatment of 
ionization losses it is convenient to have the first 
3 derivatives of A vanish as HE). 

Let us now carry through the solution for 8=0. 
For this solution we write 20, yo, Po. From (20)

From this we can readily calculate the total 
energy of gamma-rays and electrons:

The integral on the right gives the residue of the 
integrand at y=1, which is just, asa, 


2nie™* since p=a, v=—1 when y=1. 


Thus the total energy remains constant, as it 
should, when ionization losses are neglected. For 
this the condition on the constants in My 
a+6/2=1, is essential. 

When t or d are large, then (22) may most con- 
veniently be evaluated by the saddle point 
method. The approximation here involved is one 
which corresponds closely to the limitations im- 


ON MULTIPLICATIVE SHOWERS 


posed upon the physical interpretation of our 
solution by the fluctuations which must be ex- 
pected in the actual behavior of the radiation 
from the average behavior given by our diffusion 
equations. The effect of these fluctuations can be 
simply formulated by the physically obvious 
assertion that the addition or subtraction of a 
thickness of matter corresponding to t~1 has an 
even chance of not altering the actual distribu- 
tion of pairs and gamma-rays. The’ asymptotic 
form of @, y for large ¢ thus gives us results whose 
accuracy corresponds to the applicability of the 
diffusion equations themselves. 

_ The unique saddle point of the first term of the 
integrand of (22) lies on the positive real axis, at a 
point which moves out to larger y values mono- 
tonically as ¢/\ is increased. If we use a subscript 
s to indicate that functions are to be evaluated at 
this saddle point, then we find from this term

Here ul’ =p /dy?. 
From the second term of (22) 


1 dy ehytvt

we obtain a contribution which remains less than 
Qe-**, where Q is independent of \ and f, asi. 
For large ¢ this term is thus quite negligible 
compared to (24). —

be evaluated analytically. Thus (writing o=2/3).

For intermediate values we give a plot of ys 
against \/t, from which (24) may be evaluated. 


It should be observed that usys gives directly the

ratio of Po to yo, and that it never exceeds 2/3. At 
any energy and thickness ¢>1, there are always 
more y-rays than electrons. | 

The solution we have given can be readily ex- 
tended to diffusion equations with R of the 
general form (11); only the dependence of » and 
yon y becomes more complicated.

of y-rays in the radiation. : 

From (32) we see that our approximate calcu- 
lation of the effect of ionization losses is based 
upon the smallness of B/E. This parameter is 
about 12 percent for Pb, 35 percent for Fe, at 
E=50 Mev. Clearly the treatment here given is 
limited to energies E>, but within this limit it 
can tell us what the effect of these losses will be. 

In fact (22) and (31) give the first two terms in 
the asymptotic expansion in 8/E of a solution 
of (12’):

Fic. 2. Plot of total number of electrons N(¢) against #, 
for air, Ey =2500 Mev, computed from (36). The circles are 
from the experimental results of Pfotzer,* on the variation 
of vertical coincidence counting rate in the upper atmos- 
phere, at magnetic latitude ~50°N. At this latitude the 
earth’s field will just admit electrons of energy 2500 Mev. 
The deviations from the curve for £>8 may indicate the 
presence of some electrons of higher energy, as well as a 
penetrating component. 


Here the contour S in the s plane is a simple loop 
from +. counterclockwise around the origin 
and back to +; 2f; is the hypergeometric 
series and 
g=o(1t+y)/(o+zy). 

That (33) is a solution of (12’) may be verified by 
direct substitution. It is not of course the solution 
satisfying the boundary conditions (13); but an 
iteration of the arguments just given in connec- 
tion with (31) indicates that the terms which 
must be added to satisfy (13) give for ¢>1, 
EE, a negligible contribution. 

For heavy elements such as Pb, (31) gives an 
adequate approximation to (33) for all energies 
high enough to make the use of (2) permissible: 
the pair production formulae break down before 
the ionization correction becomes very large. For 
light elements, for the atmosphere, we may apply 
(33) for E<. To do this we use the analytic 
continuation of the hypergeometric series, and 
evaluate the integral over y by the saddle point 
method. For E/6 <1 we thus find

The energy dependence of y and @, which for 
E> is roughly given by k/E?, becomes, if E<8, 
ki/E, ko\n B/E, respectively. The increase in y 
and @ with decreasing energy will be still further 
reduced at still lower energies by the absorption 
of the y-rays by Compton effect. The total 
number of electrons in the range 0—8 depends 
upon 6 essentially as 

erpus 


and its maximum as a function of ¢ is quite 
closely inversely proportional to 8 or proportional 
to Z. 

The total number of electrons is easy to com- 
pute from (33):

where y, is given again by (35). The maximum 
value of N(¢) occurs for values of ¢ slightly smaller 


than Ag. We give Fig. 2 a plot of N(é) against #, for 


water, for which we have taken 8=90 Mev, and # 
is measured: in units of ~0.4m. The primary 
energy is ~2.5X10* Mev. The maximum of V 
occurs at about 1.2 meters. It would seem prob- 
able that the latitude sensitive transition effects 
of the cosmic-ray ionization in the upper atmos- 
phere are to be interpreted on this basis. 

It is futile to apply (33) to elements as heavy 
as Pb, because for energies of the order of 6 the 
radiative formulae (1), (2) and the diffusion 
equation based on them become quite wrong. As 
is well known, the actual behavior of radiation in 
the range 1-25 Mev in Pb is extremely compli- 
cated. Since the absorption coefficient for y-rays 
has a minimum value which for Pb lies at about 
3 Mev, we know that for sufficiently great 
thicknesses of matter y-radiation of roughly this 
energy will predominate over y-rays of higher or

lower energy and over electrons of all energies. 
A rough estimate of the number of low energy 
electrons we can get by computing the total 
energy degraded into the low energy region per 
unit thickness. Let us call the energy so degraded 
into an energy region 0<E<e, D,(t). This energy 
has ultimately to be absorbed by the ionization 
losses of electrons. The number of electrons 
which in a distance ¢=1 would lose by ionization 
an energy D,(¢) is 1/8D.(t); it must be remem- 
bered, however, that because of the relatively 
great penetration of the low energy gamma-rays 
(amounting for Pb to t=3-4), the low energy 
electrons actually present in the radiation at 
some fixed thickness t= 7 must be evaluated, not 
from D,(T)/8, but from some appropriately re- 
tarded value D,(T —r)/8, where r gives the effec- 
tive mean penetration of the low energy radia- 
tion, and may be of the order of 2—3 for Pb. It is 
in this sense that the curves we give for D,(#) are 
to be interpreted. For the interpretation of ob- 
servations made with the high pressure, thick- 
walled ionization chambers which are used in the 
study of bursts, the variation of D.(t) with { 
should itself give a valid estimate of the probable 
variation of the recorded size of the burst with 
absorber thickness. 

The calculation of D.(t) is straightforward.

crease it when A\<¢. We give in Fig. 3 a plot of 
D.{t) for Pb, e=25 Mev, Eo=2X10* Mev. 

Let us now restrict ourselves to E>£8, and ask 
how the shower will be altered by changes in the 
initial radiation. 

A. If the incident radiation is a y-ray of energy 
E, and not an electron, the boundary conditions 
(20) must be altered to 


F,O)=¢y; dF,(0)/dt=0. (41) 
This gives us

from which it follows that for {> 1, the number of 
gamma-rays and electrons will be changed by a 
factor —»,Vy. from the values given by (32). This 
factor varies from 0.6 to 1.6 over the range of 
values of ¢/X for which the shower is appreciable. 
The course and magnitude of the shower will 
thus depend very little on whether it is started 
by an electron or a gamma-ray. The maximum of 
the shower will come for very slightly higher ¢ 
values when it is initiated by a y-ray. 

B. If the incident radiation is a group of m 
electrons of energy E,/m, then from (24) 


Potm) =M’Po(A—In m, t);

and insofar as @(A, ¢) is quite closely of the form 
k(t)e~*’, for small variations of \, 


Potm] = Po 


for small m, and the shower will be substantially 
the same as if one electron of energy Eo had 
started it. | 

C. As long as we neglect the ionization terms, 
we can get no “‘transition effects’’ when a shower, 
built up in one substance, passes into another. 
But the terms in 8 do give us such effects, in 
apparent qualitative agreement with what is 
found experimentally. Let the radiation go a 
distance ¢, (measured in units approximate to the 
first substance) in (1), and then a distance ¢» (in 
units for (2)) in (2). Then the terms independent 
of 8 in zg are, for #:-+f.>1.

transition from Fe to Pb should increase the 
number of electrons with energy >50 Mev by 
about 35 percent. 

It must be remembered that the actual transi- 
tion effects observed are complicated by the fact 
that the high energy radiation which produces 
the showers is to some extent being regenerated 
in the material in which the showers are formed. 


IV 


In Fig. 4 we give typical energy distribution 
curves for the pairs, for Pb, and a primary energy 
of 1.5105 Mev for t=15, 8, 6, 4. In the neigh- 
borhood of \=8, the ionization corrections are 
appreciable, but for \<6 the curves will hold for 
all substances. It will be observed that these 
curves follow quite closely what we would get 
from a distribution law k/E?; thus except for =4 
they may all be represented by a law of this form 
in which the exponent of £ never differs from —2 
by more than five percent. In fact this law gives a 
very good approximation to the energy distribu- 
tion for ¢>.7\, and for all energies EXE, but 
>>. We have already pointed out that it is for 
this reason that the simplification of the diffusion 
equations made in replacing (7) by (11) is per- 
missible. Cloud chamber studies® of the energy 
distribution of shower electrons seem to fit this 


law quite well for E>25 Mev, but the experi-

mental conditions here are clearly not such as to 
make this agreement very significant. 

Because of the form of the distribution law, a 
plot of GE will give a good estimate of the total 
number of electrons to be expected with energies 
=F. For Pb, E=50 Mev, and several values of 
Eo varying from 2700 Mev up to 1.1X10® Mev 
we give such plots against ¢ (Fig. 5). The rapid 
increase with Fo of the total number of particles, 
and the slow shift in the position of the maximum, 
confirm the qualitative arguments of §2. We 
would like to interpret in terms.of this shift the 
well-known observation that the optimum transi- 
tion thickness for bursts is considerably larger 
than for showers. In fact, the agreement between 
the experimental values of the optimal transition 
thicknesses (~2 cm Pb for showers, ~5 cm Pb 
for bursts) with the position of the maxima of 
these curves, seems to us a strong argument for 
the correctness of the model we are treating, and 
of the validity of the high energy formulae we 
have used. In particular the experiments of Nie,° 
in which it is shown that a burst generated in a 
suitable layer of matter may sometimes have its 
magnitude very much increased by the inter- 
position of a few cm of Pb find a very natural 
interpretation in terms of these theoretical 
curves. It must be remembered, however, that 
the experimental transition curves, which give 
the dependence on # of the probability of finding 
a shower or burst whose magnitude exceeds a 
lower limit defined by the experimental arrange- 
ment are not strictly comparable with the curves 
of Fig. 5 which give the variation, for fixed Eo of 
the probable number of electrons.” For in making 
this comparison the initial distribution of the 
radiation over Ey must clearly be taken into 
account. We want here, too, to point out that the 
actual behavior of the radiation will fluctuate 
about that given by our curves, and that the 
order of magnitude of the probable fluctuations 
can be estimated by shifting the curves by 
Ai~ +1.

10 When counters are used to detect showers, the angular 
divergence of the shower rays is necessarily exploited. ‘If 
the theory here developed is at all correct, most of these 
rays must have a relatively low energy, of the order of 
several million volts. In fact only cloud chamber observa- 
tion can tell us much about radiation of much higher 
energy. .

Fic. 5. Plots against ¢ of @-E for E=50 Mev in Pb. 
(a) Eo=2.7X103, (b) Eop=2X10!, (c) Ho=1.5X105; 
(d) Eo=1.110* Abscissae are in units of 3 cm; ordinates 
in units of 1, 4, 10, and 50 for (a), (b), (c) and (d), re- 
spectively. These plots also give the number of electrons of 
energy 250 Mev to be expected as a function of t. 


The application of our methods to £o as low as 
2700 Mev may seem unjustified. Here our results, 
however, agree reasonably with those computed 
by Bhabha and Heitler" with neglect of ioniza- 
tion losses and of processes of high order. For 50 
Mev the inclusion of ionization losses reduces 
the number of electrons to be expected by 15-20 
percent. 

It may be helpful to give a brief summary of 
the general results. For any absorber we measure 
length (£) in units which are proportional, roughly, 
to Z’9/A, where Z is the nuclear charge, A the 
atomic weight, and p the density, and we define 
the characteristic energy 6 (see (3)), which varies 
about like 1/Z. Then, 

(1) The number of electrons per unit energy 
is about inversely. proportional to the square of 
the energy, as long as B< EE, t>49n. 

(2) For given energy and ¢>1, there are 
always more y-rays than electrons; where the 


11 Reference 8. Heitler and Bhabha give for Ey)=2.7 X 108 
Mev, a value PE=4, maximum for t=4; we get PE=4.5 
at t=4. This discrepancy, and the fact that we find the 
maximum at f~~5, are both in the direction to be expected 
from the effects of higher order processes. ) 


ON MULTIPLICATIVE SHOWERS 


shower is near its maximum, this tatio varies 
from 1.5—2. 

(3) For E> 8, the distribution curves plotted 
against ¢ are the same for all absorbers. | 

(4) The number of particles of energy greater 
than E,>8 passes through a maximum for a 
value of ¢ which increases logarithmically with 
FE, /F, and is always quite close to lng Eo/Fi. | 

(5) The maximum number of particles with an 
energy less than some small multiple of @ is 
attained for values of ¢ which are slightly smaller 
than In E)/8, and decrease: slowly with decreas- 
ing Z. The total number of particles of energy in 
this range is about inversely proportional to 8, 
or proportional to Z. 

(6) The maximum size of the shower is 
limited only by £» with which it increases not 
quite linearly: thus an increase in Ey by a factor 
of 100 gives an increase in shower size of about 70. 

(7) If the initial energy Eo is in an incident 
y-ray, or is divided among a few electrons and 


gamma-rays, the course of the shower will be 


essentially unaltered. 

(8) Passage of a shower from one material (1) 
to another (2) will increase the size of the shower 
if Z.>Z,, decreases it if Z1>Z>. The transition 
takes place in a thickness #,~1}. All of these 


231 


results apply only for energies Ey above 10% Mev. 

In this paper we have altogether neglected the 
question of how such high energy electrons and 
y-rays can get down through the atmosphere. 
How serious this difficulty is we can see from (32), 
which tells us that for every electron of energy 
~2X105 Mev which hits the earth vertically, 
only 0.15 electron of energy >550 Mev will 
survive at the earth’s surface. This difficulty is 
made even sharper when we consider the form of 
the shower curves for great thicknesses ¢ > 30, or 
the showers and bursts reported under very great 
thicknesses of absorber. In fact, although when 
we go up far in the atmosphere, the showers, and 
still more markedly, the bursts, increase more 
rapidly than the total cosmic-ray ionization, 
below the atmosphere they do not fall off much 
more rapidly than this ionization. This suggests 
that, in addition to primary electrons and per- 
haps. y-rays, which are able to produce multipli- 
cative showers directly, there is another cosmic- 
ray component, slowly absorbed, which is re- 
sponsible for the continuation of the showers 
under thicknesses of absorber to which no elec- 
tron or photon can itself penetrate. Some sug- 
gestions which we think relevant to the solution 
of this problem will be discussed in another 


paper.
