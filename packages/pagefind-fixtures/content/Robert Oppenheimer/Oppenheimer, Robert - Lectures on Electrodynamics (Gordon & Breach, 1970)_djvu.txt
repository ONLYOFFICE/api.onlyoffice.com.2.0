Preface 


** His lectures were a great experience, for experimental as well as theoretical 
physicists. In addition to a superb literary style, he brought to them a degree 
of sophistication in physics previously unknown in the United States.”’ So 
wrote Hans Bethe of Robert Oppenheimer’s qualities as a teacher during 
the decade prior to World War II. It was an exciting decade for physics, 
and Oppenheimer, holding a joint appointment at the University of Cali- 
fornia and the California Institute of Technology, was attracting a group 
of students destined to contribute to the great transformation which would 
soon propel American physics into the front rank. One of these students, 
Robert Serber, who followed Oppenheimer on his annual trek between 
Berkeley and Pasadena, has said of one of his courses: “‘It was an in- 
spirational as well as an educational achievement. He transmitted to his 
students a feeling of the beauty of the logical structure of physics and an 
excitement about the development of physics. Almost everyone listened to 
the course more than once.”’ 

Perhaps classical electrodynamics has by now lost some of the excitement 
it had in the thirties, when it was still viewed as the primary foundation 
and model for quantum electrodynamics. We have become so sophisticated 
nowadays that the theorists among us, when we think of electrodynamics, 
think of threshold theorems, off-shell amplitudes and dispersion relations— 
almost never of little radiating balls of mass and charge. And yet classical 
electrodynamics has a standard place in our curriculum. The lecture notes 
which comprise this book have been reproduced in ditto-copy form three 
times since they were first written down: in Berkeley in 1939, then at the 
University of Chicago in 1947 and again at the University of Colorado in 
1949. I am grateful to Dr. Richard Akerib for providing a personal copy 
of the latter set from which the present, and first published edition, has 
been prepared. I wish also to thank Mrs. Oppenheimer for granting the 
publisher permission to bring these lectures to a wider audience. 

Aside from some updatings of notation and corrections of obvious slips 
of the pen, very little has been changed from the original notes. I have 
improved the English in a number of places and rewritten occasional

paragraphs for clarity. In chapter 1, sections 9 and 10, I have simplified 
some derivations. There are also a few editorial remarks scattered through the 
book. Only rarely does the text itself sound dated, such as at the end of the 
paragraph preceding Eq.(11.8) and the brief excursion Into angle-and- 
action-variable perturbation theory in chapter 1, section 17. I have let such 
vignettes stand unimpaired. 

The material is as relevant now as when the lectures were first given. 
Problems are approached in a direct manner and the transition from theory 
to application occurs quickly and repeatedly. Basic difficulties are not 
avoided but are presented in a manner which is both rational and un- 
complicated. The viewpoint is by no means confined to the purely classical 
theory. Quantum ideas are introduced at every relevant occasion, and 
relativity theory is developed in a delightfully revealing way. The prereq- 
uisites for reading these notes are modest. The student should have had a 
course in electromagnetic theory and some acquaintance with elementary 
quantum theory. This will suffice to enable him to share some of the same 
joys as an earlier generation of students.

CHAPTER I 


Maxwell’s Theory 


1 INTRODUCTION: DEFINITION OF THE FIELDS 


Electrodynamics is a field theory. It deals with the electric and magnetic 
fields, supposed measurable at any point P(x,y,z) in space and at 
any time, ¢. We shall be concerned with fields measured in the 
absence of dielectrics and diamagnetics: the electric field E(x, y, z, t), the 
magnetic field H(x, y, z, t): When we have to discuss dielectric effects we 
shall try to understand them atomically; that is, in terms of the fields due 
to the charges in the medium. Then we shall have to distinguish, by the 
type of measurement involved, D from E, B from H. These are all vectors 
and functions of x, y, z, and ¢. 

Definition of the fields: We take a test body, of volume V, uniform 
charge density @, and mass M. Let it be very nearly at rest, and let it occupy 
the volume V about P for a time t about ¢. The electric field, averaged 
over V and 7 is then defined by 


p(t + t) — p(t) = VotE 


where p = Mv is the momentum, v the velocity of the test body. If p is 
to be measurable and v so small that magnetic forces can be neglected, M@ 
must be large. The precautions to make the measurement valid are: 


1) v—0O _ no magnetic forces. 


ay eG to the time and point at which E was measured. 

3) V0 

4)o0V ->0 _ to eliminate electromagnetic self-action effects of the test 
body. 


In electron theory, eV cannot be less than the electronic charge e. In 
quantum theory p cannot be measured without sacrificing the knowledge 
of the test body’s position. When atomic and quantum effects are important, 


1 Oppenheimer (4013) 1 


2 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


difficulties in definition of the field arise. The quantum limitations are well 
understood and form the physical basis of the breakdown of classical 
electromagnetic theory. 

The analogous definition of H would use a distribution uw of magnetic 


poles: 
p(t + 7) — p(t) = VutH 


and the same precautions as for E. We have no single poles, but we use 
the ends of long needles. The H so measured gives a force on a moving 
charge e, the Lorentz law of force, 


Fa P nek +i x} 
dt c 


We can use this to extend the definition of H. 


2 MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 


In the Gaussian system of units, Maxwell’s equations are 


V-E = 420 (2.1) 
V-H=0 (2.2) 
H 
VxE=-—- neh (2.3) 
c Ot 
Vx H= ace + Anj (2.4) 
c Ot 


where 0 and j are the charge and current densities. The first three equations 
are the expressions of experimental facts in differential form. (2.1) is 
Coulomb’s law for electric charges; (2.2) is Coulomb’s law for magnetic 
poles, supplemented by the fact that no free magnetic poles exist in nature; 
(2.3) is Faraday’s law of induction. (2.4) is a generalization of Ampere’s 
law 

V x H = 4nj 


10 
by the addition of the term—— a which is called Maxwell’s displacement 


current. Maxwell added this term since otherwise the equation leads to 


V-j=0 


MAXWELL’S THEORY 3 


and this is not true for non-steady flow of current. When the term is in- 
cluded, we get 


V-j=-—— (2.5) 
and if we write 
oe | 
j=—ve 
c 
we have the usual equation of continuity 


é 
V-(ov) + = 0 
ot 


Makxwell’s additional term is also necessary to have E and H satisfy the 
wave equation in free space. If the term is not included, we get 


AE =0 
AH = 0 


(4=V-V) 


which do not admit plane wave solutions and hence contradict experience. 


ExercisE 1 Describe an experiment whereby the existence of Maxwell’s displacement 
current is verified directly. 
EXERCISE 2 Show that the equation 

V xX H= 4yj 
follows directly from the equivalence between a current circuit and a suitable magnetic 
shell. 


3 SOLUTION OF THE EQUATIONS IN FREE SPACE 


At first sight it may be thought that from Maxwell’s equations given above 
and from the Lorentz force 
f=eE+jxH (3.1) 


(f = force density) we could compute the charge and current distribution o, 
j and the fields E and H from given initial conditions. But besides the 
mathematical difficulty, there is the yet unsolved problem of how the self- 
field of a charge affects its motion. Hence, we have to limit ourselves to 
the less ambitious problem of calculating the field produced by a given 
charge and current distribution, and conversely the charge and current 
from a given field. In this way we may approach the general solution by 
successive approximation. 


4 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


First we shall consider the solution of Maxwell’s equations in free space. 
Putting 9 = 0, and j = 0, we have 


V-E=0 (3.2) 
V-H=0 (3.3) 
vere eet (3.4) 
c Ot 
Vx fo (3.5) 
c Ot 


Taking the curl of the last two equations and noting that 


VxVx=VV:-A (3.6) 
we get 
OE=0 (3.7) 
OH=0 (3.8) 
by using the first two equations. Here 
1 6? 
O = -—— +4 3.9 
c? Gt? eo 


and is known as the d’Alembertian operator. 
Suppose each component of E, H is a function of z and ¢ only. Then 


1 OE,  E, 


are: a 0; (i = x, y, z) (3.10) 
a set (3.11) 
c? dt? dz? 
The solutions of these equations are 
E, =fi(z + ct) + F(z - ct) (3.12) 
H, = gz + ct) + G,(z — ct) (3.13) 


In order that they satisfy Maxwell’s equation, we have from (3.2) and (3.3) 


MAXWELL’S THEORY 5 


and hence from (3.12) and (3.13), E, = 0, H, = 0, apart from a constant 

field which is of no interest here, which shows that electromagnetic waves 

are transverse waves. In free space the direction of the electric and magnetic 

vectors is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. 

Let E be along the x-axis; then E, = E, = 0. From (3.4) and (3.5) we get 
OF, __ 1 OH, , OH, 1 OE,

Cz c ¢t oz c Ot 


and H, = H, = 0. Thus E, H, z, where z is the direction of propagation, 
form a right-handed orthogonal system of vectors, and we have 


£, = f(z + ct) + F(z — ct) 
HH, = —f(z + ct) + F(z — ct) 


as solutions of Maxwell’s equations. 
Let us consider the special case of monochromatic waves. Then 


f(z + ct) = R{Ae*Et?} 


where R{ } denotes the real part. If n is a unit vector in the direction of 
propagation, then 


ken ee nan 
c A 


is called the propagation vector. Let us introduce unit vectors &/, &? so that 
e, e?, n form a right-handed system of orthogonal unit vectors. Then for 
a monochromatic wave propagating in the direction n, 


E = st{aielk-n - ot) 3 gie ik-n- ae 
H = £7{b2ehK 8 - wt) Be b2e7 tka =n) 


Here we have written w = kc. We can obtain the most general expression 
for E and H in free space by superposition of plane waves, thus:

Remembering that

k x ef = —key,

and the complex conjugates of these equations. 

The fields can be expanded in terms of any other complete set of ortho- 
gonal functions, but the above Fourier expansion is convenient as it is 
simple analytically and we shall see later that the energy and momentum 
of radiation can be expressed simply in terms of the coefficients a. Also, 
though the field near a radiating charge is very complicated, at large 
distances away it can be expressed as a sum of plane waves and a coulomb 
field. 


4 APPLICATIONS TO THE SKIN EFFECT AND METALLIC REFLECTION 


Consider a semi-infinite conductor. As long as the dimensions of the skin 
are small compared to the radius of curvature of the wire, we can use the 
result derived above to study the skin effect in wires. Inside the conductor 


j=—oE (4.1)

where g is the conductivity. First let us consider copper since for this metal, 
both the dielectric constant x and the permeability uw can be taken as unity.

Let us choose our axes so that the xy plane is parallel to the boundary 
surface of the metal, and let radiation of frequency w and plane polarized 


in the x direction be incident normally on the boundary. Then 


E,(z, t) = f(z) e~ 
H,(z, t) = g(z)e" ** 


and we shall use the convention of taking the real part of E and H as the 


actual field. Assume 
0 = F(z) e- iwt 


Then the conservation equation

and hence 
F(z) = 0

and

1/n is the distance from the boundary to the point in the metal where the 
strength of the field drops to 1/e of the value at the boundary, and hence 
it is a measure of the thickness of the skin when an alternating current of 
frequency w/2z is flowing in the metal. 


EXERCISE 3 Find the value of w for which 1/n = 10-3 cm in copper.

ExercisE 4 Describe an experiment whereby y can be measured as a function of w. 


The reflecting power of metals can be found by solving a simple boundary 
value problem. The procedure is to adjust the amplitude and phases of 
the reflected and transmitted waves so that E and H are continuous at the 
boundary. From (4.4) and (4.5) we see that H also satisfies Eq. (4.7) 
so that 

Hy = Be“'* — nz — lot

EXERCISE 5 Calculate r for copper (4 = 1) for the value of w such that 1/n = 10-3 cm. 


5 ENERGY AND MOMENTUM OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD 


The energy and momentum of a test body are well defined. We consider 
the changes in them caused by the interaction with an electromagnetic 
field and assign such values of the energy and momentum to the electro- 
magnetic field that the laws of conservation of energy and momentum will 


10 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


be satisfied. From this we see that since only changes in the energy and 
momentum of an electromagnetic field are defined, they are undetermined 
by an additive constant. We shall see later that the theory of relativity 
determines this constant. 

First we shall consider the energy. If E and pare the energy and momentum 
of a test body, we have 


AE=F-dAr 
= (F-v)4t 
where 
F =o0V{E+ 1yx H} 
c 
Therefore 1 AE 
—— =oE-y 
V At 
= cE:j (5.1) 
Similarly from 
Ap =FAt 
we get ,

We shall require that 
F ow 


where 
W = the energy density of the electromagnetic field 


S = the flux of electromagnetic energy 


and obtain an expression for W and S in terms of E and H. Equation (5.3) 
is a statement of the law of conservation of energy. 
Now from vector analysis we have 


E-V x H—H-V x E= -V:(E x H) 
Therefore using Maxwell’s Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) we get 
oE 1 cH

Hence

S =—ExH (5.5) 
4n 


We see that the formula for the energy density W is the same as that 
in electro- and magnetostatics. On the other hand if we apply the formula 
for energy flux to the case of uniform static fields, with E perpendicular 
to H, we obtain a nonvanishing result. This seems strange, but as V:S = 0, 
there is no difficulty. 


EXERCISE 6 Consider the case where E is still perpendicular to H but they are not 
uniform. It seems that €W/Cr does not vanish. Is Y - S equal to zero? 


For the momentum, we shall require an equation of the form 


+ (E+ Gx HW} +V-T=0 (5.6) 


which expresses the law of conservation of momentum. We shall obtain 
the formula 


G=—S (5.7) 


for the momentum of the radiation, and shall obtain an expression for 
Maxwell’s “‘stress tensor’ T. Using (2.3) and (2.4) we get

Further, in free space E is perpendicular to H and |E| = |H| so that

simply as single sums. To show this, we have (3.14)

6 RADIATION FROM A CHARGE AND CURRENT DISTRIBUTION 


We shall first give a method of calculation which is most convenient when 
only the rate of radiation of energy is required. We write E as the sum of 
“transverse” and “‘longitudinal”’ fields E, and E, respectively, which are 
defined as follows: V-E, =0 


In other words, we break up E into its solenoidal and irrotational parts. 
Maxwell’s Eqs. (2.3) and (2.1) then become 


V x E, = _l oH 
c Ot 
We can write 
E, = —Ve 
Ay = —4z0 
and 
r’, t) dr’ 
P(r, t) = eee (6.1) 
r—r| 


E, = ~V o(r’, t) dr 
r—r 


E,, is calculated by keeping ¢ constant. Maxwell’s equations can now be 
written in the form 


V-E, = (6.2) 
V-H=0 (6.3)

and using the equation of continuity (2.5) we obtain

Thus E, takes out the longitudinal part from j. Hence E, and H can be 
represented in terms of transverse waves. We shall write 
1 GE 
4nj, = 4nj + —- —1 

* c ot 
It means that only the component of j perpendicular to the propagation 
vector excites transverse electric waves. For if we make a Fourier expansion 
of j,

Thus the expansion of j, is 
LE O=T [dkellede ne +20 ne} — 66) 
A=1,2 


This follows from the fact that, since V-j, = 0, j, cannot have any com- 
ponent parallel to k. 

We now introduce a vector potential A(r, ¢), which we define in this 
case by the following equations: 


H=VxA 

1 GA 

E, = —--_— 

qi c ¢ét 
V-A=0 


Then Eqs. (6.2), (6.3) and (6.4) are automatically satisfied, and we are 
left with just (6.5), which becomes 


= 47j, (6.7) 


Let us now make a Fourier expansion of A. Since V- A = 0, A has no 
component parallel to k. Hence 


A=y i dk el{n,(k, 1) e™*™ + A,(k, t) e~™"} (6.8) 
A=1,2 
where 1 
nk, t) = —~ | dr A(r, t): ek e~ ™

This is the differential equation of forced oscillation. Its complementary 
solution, that is, the free vibration, is given by 


th, = L,(k) e'** + M,(k) e7'** 


MAXWELL’S THEORY 19 
Putting this into (6.8) and calculating E , We get

Let us apply (6.12) to calculate the radiation from an antenna. Consider 
a current in a conductor whose breadth is very small compared to its length

We note that when n is perpendicular to r,(sin@ = 1) this result gives the 
same value as the approximate expression obtained above for A > L. 
Consider a spherically symmetric charge distribution which oscillates 
radially. Such an oscillation of charge cannot give rise to any radiation, 
for we have seen that only the part of the current perpendicular to the 
propagation vector gives any radiation, and if we consider any plane through 
the charge distribution, to any point P, then on the plane there is a point P’, 
symmetrically placed with respect to it, where the value of the current is 
equal and opposite to that at P. Thus the integral (6.12) vanishes, and 
there is no radiation. Another proof can be given by using Gauss’s theorem, 


which states that the field outside a spherically symmetric distribution of 
charge is the same as that when all the charge is concentrated at the center. 
It follows from this that with our distribution of charge the field is radial 
and constant. Hence there is no radiation. 

Let us now consider radiation from an atomic system. In nonrelativistic 
theory, the expression for the matrix element of the current between two 
stationary states m and n is 


i

Now if d is the size of the charge distribution and

Hence

Prad < 1 


Pp charge 


Thus if any one of the three equivalent conditions obtain 
Ijbd<a 
2) Ucharge < c 


3) Praa < Peharge 


then it will be sufficient to expand the exponential and take the first few 
terms. The condition holds for optical transitions in atoms, y-ray emission 
from nuclei, and for some macroscopic systems. Taking just the first term 
of the exponential, that is, replacing it by unity, corresponds to leaving 
out the recoil of the charge since then the absolute values of E and H are 
not changed by replacing n by —n. It also corresponds to leaving out the 
magnetic field of the charge in motion since taking the exponent zero 
means taking Ucnarge = 0. And finally it corresponds to neglecting the phase 
difference between radiations emitted from different parts of the charge 
distribution. 

The usual procedure in making the calculation is to expand the ex-

very much, so its dipolo moment is small. However, it can have a large 
quadrupole moment by deforming its shape, and it turns out that the 
quadrupole radiation is of the same order of magnitude as the dipole 
radiation, although vd/c is quite small. 

The classification of radiation is done in two ways: 

1) by k, the power of the exponent, 

2) by the angular distribution of the radiation. 


a) Electric dipole radiation (k = 0) 


For this case

and hence the angular distribution of the radiation is 


S oc sin? 6 


b) Magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole radiations (k = 1)

Now y;, is a tensor, and it can be broken up into symmetric and anti- 
symmetric parts: 
Vis =4(Yis + Ysi) + 41s — si) 


The symmetric part gives the electric quadrupole radiation, and the anti- 
symmetric part the magnetic dipole radiation. 
First let us consider the magnetic dipole radiation. Let 


1 iv ¢., , : 
my = 5(ie — Yad) = — | lip x Wh 


where 1¢, 7, s form a cyclic permutation of x, y, z. We see that m is the 
moment of the current. Replacing y;, by m, in (8.4) and using the anti- 
symmetric properties, we get 


e; = [n x m], 


h; = n,(n * m) — Mm; 


Comparing these equations with (8.1), we see that the field of the magnetic 
dipole may be obtained from that of the electric dipole by making the 
correspondences 

h.>e,, @—2-—h,, J7m 


Hence the angular distribution of the radiation is again given by 
S oc sin? 6

However the magnitude of S is in general smaller by the factor (5) ;

and if the mass density wu is proportional to the charge density o, the magnetic 
dipole moment is proportional to the moment of mementum

Since this is constant for an isolated system, it cannot have magnetic 
dipole radiation. This would be true for electrons in atoms if the electron 
did not have a spin with a g-factor of approximately 2 rather than unity. 
A ring of current which varies harmonically with time has magnetic dipole 
moment. However, such oscillation cannot occur in an isolated system if 
H/o is constant, for the angular momentum of such a system cannot os- 
cillate. 

Let us now consider the electric quadrupole moment.* The symmetric 
part of »;, has 6 components, but only 5 independent quantities determine 
this radiation. This follows from the fact that the values of e and h are 
unaltered by an addition of diagonal terms y 6,, to y;,, and this is related 
to the fact that the radial component of the current does not give rise to 
any radiation.

44 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


If we can find the angular distribution of radiation from atoms, then we 
can tell what kind of radiation it is and hence learn something about the 
atom. However, we cannot find it by measuring the intensity of the radiation 
at different directions since we have to have many atoms and these would 
be oriented at random. The radiation from a single atom is coherent, 
but radiations from different atoms are incoherent. It has been suggested 
that the study of the interference properties of the radiation from atoms 
would give the type of radiation. 

The character of y-radiation from nuclei may be found by studying the 
field at a distance r from the nucleus such that 


r>d 
r<d 


This region is called the diffraction zone. Under these conditions, we can 
still expand the exponential 


t= |r-1"| 
and we can also expand 


1 
lr —r'| 


, 


aD > (=) P, (cos (r, r’)) 
r‘Ee\r 


Thus the electric dipole field falls off as 1/r, the magnetic dipole and electric 
quadrupole field as 1/r?, etc. Hence the fields of the higher multipoles 
become relatively larger as we go nearer the nucleus. Now there are electrons 
around the nucleus, and their reactions to the field tell us the character 
of the radiation. In the actual calculation it is found more convenient to 
use the expansion

(10.1) and (10.2) are called the Lienard—Wichert potentials. They are 
rigorous for idealized point charges. Their validity when the charge is 
spread over a domain of dimension d may be determined as follows. The 
retarded time for different points of the charge distribution now varies 
by an amount 4t,,, ~ d/c. Also R varies by an amount AR ~ d. In order

As long as these conditions are satisfied, the above expressions for the

case of electrons or nuclei; the formulae may be applied to macroscopic 
charges, such as a charged pith ball. For electrons we usually consider

We can see qualitatively why an approaching charge gives a larger 
field than a receding one at the same distance. The retarded time at A is 
later than that at B and so for the approaching charge, A is effectively 


B oe? 


er 
e Fy 


further away from B, while for the receding charge, A is effectively nearer B 
than the actual distance. This means that the approaching charge has the 
effect of a larger charge, and the receding charge a smaller one. Thus the 
former gives a larger field at P than the latter. 

If we apply this idea to nebulae, we must have more nebulae to give 
the observed intensity when they are receding than when they are at rest 
with respect to the earth.

from the retarded position, due to interference, the lines of electric force 
point from the instantaneous position of the charge. We also see that the 
field is not spherically symmetric as in the static case, but is stronger in 
the direction perpendicular to the line of motion than along it. In other 
words, the lines of force are more dense in the equatorial plane than in

pulse of radiation. We shall apply this idea to find how the ionizing power 
of particles varies with the velocity. Consider the case where a charged 
particle such as an «-particle or an electron passes by an atom. Most of 
the effect will be due to the transverse electric field and, of this, only the 


Fourier component which is in resonance with the atomic electron will be 
effective. Thus, taking the Fourier component, we have

Thus H is always perpendicular to E and to n,,,. The first part of E is 
nearly parallel to n’ for ordinary velocities, and the second part is exactly 
perpendicular to n’ which can be seen immediately by taking a scalar 
product with n’. The first term, which falls off as 1/R’?, gives the quasi- 
static field, while the second falls off as 1/R’ and gives the wave zone field.

13. RATE OF RADIATION OF ENERGY FROM AN ACCELERATED 
POINT CHARGE 


We have seen that the general expression of E for a charged particle can 
be considered as a sum of two terms: The first, which is the same as that 
for a uniform velocity, and the second, which depends on the acceleration. 
For the latter part, E, H and h are perpendicular to each other, and 
|E] = |H|, and this is the field of the electromagnetic waves radiated by 
the particle. Thus

At first sight it seems that the total rate of radiation may be obtained by 
integrating S over a sphere with the center at the retarded position of the 
charge. However, this procedure does not give the correct result. To see 
why this is so, let us look at the problem in more detail. Suppose AB is 


64 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


the trajectory of the particle. At time ¢, let its position be Q. The radiation 
which arrives at P, at time t, came from the retarded position Q’ and the 
radiation emitted at Q’ lies on the surface of the sphere, S,, with center 
at Q’ andradius R, = Q’P,. If we consider another point, P2, the radiation 
there at time ¢ came from Q” and the radiation emitted at Q”’ lies on the 


surface of the sphere, S,, with center at Q’’ and radius R, = Q’’P,. It 
is clear that in general the energy flowing across S, will not be equal to 
that flowing across S,. This is why we cannot obtain the rate of radiation 
by considering the flow of S energy across a fixed sphere. The correct 
method is to consider the spheres S,; and S, to move outward with the 
radiation at velocity c. Then the energy of radiation enclosed within S, 
and S, will be constant, and the rate of radiation is this energy divided 
by the time taken to radiate it. Now the energy within S, and S,, when 
their radii differ by dR, is

Hence, our condition is that the fraction of the energy radiated be small,

Bremsstrahlung may be looked upon as due to “shaking off” of quanta 

from the field of an electron which is given a sudden jerk. The fields of 

the electron before and after the acceleration are different, and, if this

change occurs in a time, t, the Fourier components of the original field 
with 1/y < t, cannot adjust themselves to the change within this time, 
and the difference in the components of the two fields comes off as radiation. 
The vector potential of the particle before collision is 


remembering that we are making the assumption v < c. After the collision, 
it is 


We make the assumption that the collision time is very short compared

just after the collision to be the same. Thus the change in the vector

The meaning of AW can be understood better by considering the follow- 
ing analogy. A harmonic oscillator is undergoing forced oscillation with 
an amplitude A. Suddenly the magnitude of the external force is altered 
so that the amplitude of the forced oscillation is A’. The position of the 
oscillator at the instant when the change occurs does not correspond to 
that due to the new forced oscillation alone, and the difference is taken 
care of by the excitation of free oscillation of amplitude equal to the 
corresponding positions of the oscillator under the influence of the old 
and new forced oscillations at the instant when the change occurs. 4 
corresponds to the amplitude of the free oscillation, and to obtain the 
vector potential of the radiation field, we must multiply each Fourier 
component by the corresponding time factor which we may conveniently 
take as

15 RADIATION REACTION 


Let us now consider some effects of the radiation on the charge radiating 
it. We shall restrict ourselves to the case v < c since we can always make a 
Lorentz transformation to a system where this condition holds. From (13.2) 


76 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


the energy radiated per unit time from a charge with acceleration V is 
2e7¥? 


3c3 


The possible sources of this energy are 1) energy in the field, i.e. = (E? + H?) 
70 


and 2) energy of the charge, kinetic or potential. Now if the charge executes 
periodic motion, the field energy may vary but in a periodic way so that 
the energy of radiation must come from that of the charge. We shall find 
that there is a force of radiation reaction, F which causes damping and 
hence decreases the energy of the charge. Thus, strictly speaking, there is 
no real harmonic oscillator in nature. The reaction does work atthe rate F-v 
so that in order to conserve energy we would like to have 


F-v + — 

3). 362 
zero. However, this condition is too stringent, and we actually have it 
equal to 


d 
mI 


so that the energy radiated over a certain interval of time is a constant 
which does not depend on the length of the interval. In fact, it takes into 
account the difference of the energies in the field at the initial and final 
times. One possible expression for F is 


2 e

This ensures conservation of energy, but in the case V = const., we have 
a paradox that energy is radiated though there is no radiation reaction. 
Where does the energy of the radiation come from?

at t = 0 then an electron will instantly acquire a very large velocity and 
shoot off to infinity. Thus there is something drastically wrong. This shows 
that we must be careful in using the radiation reaction force. We shall 
derive the expression for the radiation reaction by considering the self- 
force and give the conditions of validity of the expression. 


82 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


The calculation of the self-force on an electron was first given by Lorentz. 
We assume the charge distribution is rigid, so that at any instant each 
element of charge will have the same velocity. We also assume v < c and 
shall keep only the terms linear in v, V, ¥ etc. Since the magnetic field is 


proportional to v and hence the self-force due to it to v?, we shall neglect 
this force, and consider just the self-force due to the electric field.

16 SELF-ENERGY OF THE ELECTRON 


We see from the expression (15.8) for F* that a charged body has more 
inertia than an uncharged body. The total inertial force of a body is 


F,, = —mv

where m is its experimental mass. The electromagnetic contribution to this 
force is

For macroscopic problems F,,, < F;,and F,.,, may be neglected. However, 
for the elementary particle, we cannot separate the two. Now F,,, cannot 
be greater than F,,, and it seems a plausible assumption that the two are 
of the same order of magnitude. This means 


e2 


Qw~ 


mc? 
= 2.8 x 10-13cm 


for the electron. If the electron had only electromagnetic mass, the equation 
of motion could be written 
F=F,+F, =0 


where F, is the self force and F, is the external force acting on the electron: 


F, = eB in E x Ha. 
c 


In this case the whole idea of mass is unnecessary. This was Abraham’s 
idea, but the theory does not work. There must be some non-electromagnetic 
force to keep the electron from blowing up. The fact that a static distribution 
of charge cannot be in equilibrium without any external force is Earnshaw’s 
theorem. The theorem states that a charged body cannot rest in stable 
equilibrium under the influence of electric fields alone. It might be thought 
that a suitable distribution of current and charge in an electron would 
keep it together, but a quite general proof can be given to show that this 
is not possible. Consider 
f=oeE+jxH 
The equation of motion is 
= 0 


if E and H include both external and self fields. A solution of f = 0 for 
E and H just external fields is possible since one solution is E = 0 and H 


MAXWELL’S THEORY 87 


parallel to j. However, there is no solution if E and H include the self 
fields. For we can write 

j x H= -oE 
and the right side vanishes only if 9 = 0 since we have V- E = 9. Thus we 
have three non-homogeneous linear equations for j,,j,, and j, with the 
determinant of their coefficients 


Ob . aie 2a 
—H, 0 H,| =0 
Hy —-H, 0 
since it is a general theorem that the determinant of an antisymmetric 
matrix of odd rank is zero. Hence there is no non-zero solution for j. 
Thus a part my of the mass must be of non-electromagnetic origin, and 


the equation of motion is 
Mov = F, + F,

For the electron, however, U is not negligible. 
In view of the instability of charges under the action of electromagnetic 
forces alone, we are led to two possibilities: 1) Maxwell’s equations do 


88 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


not hold in regions comparable to the size of the electron. Born has developed 
a theory of this form, but it is not unique and there is as yet no evidence 
that it describes reality. An acceptable theory would show that 


which contains both # and c. Thus the theory must be both quantum 
mechanical and relativistic. There is at present no satisfactory theory. 
2) Accept the stability of the electron as a fact. The theory of relativity 
shows that E = mc? so that the factor 4/3 multiplying U is a direct in- 
dication of the fact that other forces are present. This force must necessarily 
be attractive and hence give rise to negative mass. It is reasonable to assume 
that it is equal to — 4 U/c? thus giving for the total mass just U/c?. 

Since we do not know the distribution of the charge inside the electron, 
the terms of higher order than the radiation reaction in the calculation of 
chapter 15 cannot be calculated. Hence we can only treat the problem in 


o<l where a > 3 x 10-1 cm, for the electron.

mc?a U : : q 
then 5 <1, or —— m. This means that in order to keep the total 
e Cc 


mass of the electron equal to m, there must be a large amount of negative 
non-electromagnetic mass. It is by increasing this negative mass that the 


MAXWELL’S THEORY 89 


kinetic energy of the electron can increase so explosively. Since we do not 
actually observe an electron shooting off to infinity by itself, it means that 
U ~ mce?. 

Whether the electron theory is applicable to a particular problem requires 
close analysis. Consider the Bremsstrahlung of very high energy electrons 
with emission of hard y-rays which occurs in cosmic ray showers. It seems 
at first that on account of the velocity of the electrons being very close 
to c, and their very high energy, the problem cannot be treated. However, 
on using the coordinates moving with the electron, the y-rays appear very 
soft on account of the Doppler effect, and the problem can be treated. 


The calculation has actually been verified by the observations on cascade 
showers. 


17 CLASSICAL THEORY OF SCATTERING AND DISPERSION 


In this chapter we shall treat a few problems in the classical electron theory 
of matter. For atomic electrons, v/c ~ 1/100, and, since optical light waves 
do not give the electron much additional velocity, it is justified to neglect 
relativistic effects. We shall consider matter to be composed of isotropic 
oscillators. Then an external field induces a moment m in such a body 


m = oE 
For non-isotropic oscillators the expression is 
m=a:E 


where « is a tensor. For light waves, E is periodic, so the charges are 
accelerated and hence radiate. This accounts for the phenomena of scattering 
and dispersion. The two phenomena are related but are observed by two 
independent experiments. 


Let us first suppose that the oscillators are harmonic: then considering 
just one dimension we have 


mx + mw*x = eE, 
with a correction for the radiation reaction. We shall write

MAXWELL’S THEORY 9] 


We see that the scattered light will consist only of frequencies » and w, 
and this is a misleading result arising from the special model of oscillators 
we chose. If they are not strictly harmonic, there would be frequencies of 
vy + tw where t = 0, +1, +2,... This is the Raman effect and is not a 
quantum mechanical effect. It arises from the fact that a general periodic 
motion with period T is given by 


+= a p Age" 


where t = 0, +1, +2,... and wT = 2a. In general A, will be large only 
for low harmonics. A harmonic motion is a very special case where A, = 0 
for all t except +1. In dispersion, we are only interested in the coherent 
radiation, and the model of the harmonic oscillator is good. 

We shall first consider scattered waves of the same frequency as the

Let us now consider dispersion and absorption of radiation in a dielectric.

The propation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric may be treated 
in either of two ways. The first method is to take Maxwell’s equation in a 
material medium, and get

ce? ot? E 


Then use the relation between «¢, the dielectric constant, and a 


—1 41x, 
é, +2 3 


which holds for any frequency v. This equation is a consequence of the 
well-known relation between polarization and the external field, 


Pa a(E +32?) 


The second method which leads to the same result is to take Maxwell’s 
equation for a vacuum and introduce the charge and current due to the 
oscillators. We have

We shall consider a definite frequency v and write 
E = Ee" (17.6) 


Also, since most of the macroscopic properties of the body will depend 
only on the space averages of the quantities, we shall take the average

over a volume containing a large numbers of oscillators, but with dimensions 
small compared to the wavelength A. Then

The field E, is not the averaged field E. It is the average field which would 
exist at the location of an oscillator if that oscillator were absent, and it 


is given by

100 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


a pulse of radiation will disappear before it moves a distance equal to its 
own width. Ed.] 


EXERCISE 23 Calculate the value of the penetration depth at resonance. 


Let us now interpret our result in the light of modern atomic theory. 
Actually, a dielectric is composed not of harmonic oscillators but of atoms 
in the normal state, and they have a set of excited states, and there is 
resonance for each possible transition with frequency given by 


E, — Eo 
h 


The scattered radiation may not be of the same frequency as the absorbed 
frequency, and in this case we have the Raman effect, but this effect is 
small, and, since it is incoherent, it does not affect the propagation of the 
initial wave except that it gives a small absorption. In our model, this 
effect is neglected. Aside from this, the atoms act like a collection of 
oscillators. Each possible transition acts like an oscillator of frequency 


v= =

h 
and the number of oscillators with frequency «, in a unit volume is 
M, = Nacine te 


where f, is a proper fraction. In a single atom, each transition corresponds 
to a fraction f, of an oscillator, and f, is called the oscillator strength of 
the transition. If the values of f,, w, are found either empirically or by 
quantum mechanical calculations and then put in (17.”) very good results 
are obtained. The quantum mechanical calculation for f, and «, can only 
be done for a few simple cases, and there is no general argument by which 
we can find these values for complex atoms. For example, in one-valence- 
electron atoms, H, Na, Cs, the f, corresponding to the transition from the 
normal state to the first excited state are 0.35, 0.975, 0.98 respectively.

The equation of motion of a particle with mass m and charge e in an 
non-electromagnetic potential field V is

If there is in addition an external electromagnetic field E and H, the 


equation is

We want to find a function H of the canonically conjugate variables p,, x;

which is the same as (18.2). 

This theory can be used to deduce Larmor’s theorem very simply. The 
theorem states that the effect of a uniform magnetic field H on a charged 
particle describing a closed orbit is to leave the form of the orbit, its in- 
clination to the magnetic lines of force, and the motion in the orbit un- 
altered, and merely leads to the addition of a uniform precession of the 
orbit about the direction of the lines of force, the precession velocity being

CHAPTER 2 


Special Theory of Relativity 


19 TRANSFORMATION OF NEWTON’S EQUATIONS 


Suppose we have two charges, e, one fixed at the origin, and the other at 
the point (0, y, 0) of a coordinate system at rest with respect to us. The 
equation of motion of the second charge is then 


e2 
yy? 
Next consider the case when the charges are moving with velocity v, 


(uniform) with respect to us. In section 11 we saw that the field in the equa- 
torial plane of a uniformly moving point charge is 


my = (19.1) 


e 
v2 
1 — —(j? + 2?) 
c2 


Now the force on one due to the magnetic field of the other is 


EE, = 


.|~ x 4] = e[B x (B x B)] 
by (11.7) and hence : 


= e{(B - E) B — f’E} 


Thus for two particles moving together in a direction perpendicular to 
their line of centers, the magnetic force is 


— eB Ey 
Hence the total force acting on one particle is 


F= el — BE, 
eae ee 
y 


105 


106 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


and the equation of motion is 
e2 —————— 
mp =—J/1— B (19.2) 
y 


Let us now follow the charges so that they seem to be at rest with respect 
to us. We would expect to get the equations of motion in this new situation 
by making the usual transformation 


x’ =x -— ut 
y=y 
Z=2 
on (19.2). The result is = : (19.3) 
mm oats = (19.4) 


This is different from (19.1) and it means that the phenomenon depends 
on the state of motion of the system with respect to a certain fixed system. 
It is important to note that the Eqs. (19.1) and (19.4) differ by terms in 
the second order of 8 = v/c. Since in most natural phenomena v/c < 1, 
it is useful to classify terms in the powers of v/c. 

e

Next suppose that the charges are staggered so that the line joining them 
is not perpendicular to the line of motion. Then 


E= e(l — B)r 
r(1 — B? sin? 6)*/?

(19.5) 


which shows that the direction of the force is not along the radius vector, 
and for v > c, the direction approaches that of the velocity. Thus, if the 
simple transformation laws are correct, we could find, by observing the 
behavior of charges, how fast and in what direction we were moving with 
respect to the preferred reference frame in which the phenomenon takes 
a simple form. 

Thus we are led to one of three possible conclusions: 


1) The above prediction is correct, and we can find a system in which 
the equation of motion takes a simple form. According to this theory 
the earth cannot be moving with a very high velocity with respect to the 
preferred system, since we do not observe the complications predicted 
above. 

2) There is something wrong in the calculation of the field made above. 
This means that Maxwell’s equations hold only in a certain coordinate 
system. 


3) The transformation equations used in going from one coordinate 
system to another moving with respect to it are not correct. 


In considering the validity of Maxwell’s equations, we need not consider 
the whole set but only the wave equation which E and H satisfy as a 
consequence of Maxwell’s equations: 

1 0?E 


Cc Ce 


—- AE=0 


This equation does not transform to a similar equation in the primed 
variables under the transformation (19.3), which is called the Galilean 
transformation. It is due to the fact that the velocity of light, c, is not 
constant for all systems under such a transformation. The reason for 
choosing the Galilean transformation in the first place is that under such 
a transformation Newton’s equation 


mx =F 


108 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


retains its form in all systems. Thus, if we rule out the first possibility, we 
have to make a choice whether to keep Maxwell’s or Newton’s equations 
as holding universally. We shall find that Newton’s equation has to be 
modified. 


20 MICHELSON-MORLEY AND KENNEDY-THORNDYKE 
EXPERIMENTS 

The possibility of the earth having an absolute motion with respect to the 
rest system in which the equations describing natural phenomena take a 
simple form was first tested experimentally by Michelson and Morley. 
They argued that if the earth has an absolute motion, the velocity of light 
would be different in different directions, and hence there should be a 
shift in the fringes of an interferometer when it is rotated through 90°. 

The figure shows the schematic layout of an interferometer. M, and M, 
are mirrors at the ends of two arms, and M is a half-silvered mirror which 


splits the light coming from S. Suppose the arm (1) is parallel to the direction 
of the absolute velocity v; then the time taken for the light to go from 
M to M, and back to M is

Now if the system is rotated through 90° so that arm (2) is parallel and 
arm (1) is perpendicular to the absolute velocity, the corresponding times 
are

The experiment performed by Michelson and Morley was accurate enough 
to detect a few tenths of a percent of the expected fringe shift if for v the 
velocity of the earth in its orbit was taken. However no shift was observed. 

To explain the null result, Fitzgerald and Lorentz advanced the con- 
traction hypothesis which states that all lengths parallel to the direction 
of the absolute velocity contract in the ratio 


I, => va — Bl, 


which is the same as a contraction in the ratio of 1: /1 — B? between the 
length at rest and in motion.

110 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


Thus since the velocity of the earth in its orbit should make v vary with 
time, we would expect a gradual shift during a year in the fringes of a 
stationary interferometer. This experiment was done by Kennedy and 
Thorndyke, and it also led to a null result. This observation can be explained, 
if, in addition to the contraction in length, we have a dilation in time: 


oe ale 

V1 = 6? 
where Ar is a time interval recorded by a clock which moves along with 
the interferometer, and At is the corresponding interval recorded by a 
clock which is at rest with respect to the absolute frame. Since the wavelength 
of the light used in the interferometer is determined by atomic clocks 


(i.e., excited atoms) which move with the interferometer, Eq. (20.7) should 
under the time dilation hypothesis, be replaced by 


At 


ff oa, = eae independent of 
c 

[The length contraction hypothesis may be made plausible by refering 
to Eq. (19.5) which gives the force between two moving charges. In this 
equation r is the separation vector between the two charges as measured 
in the absolute frame. If the length contraction hypothesis is correct then 
the separation vector as measured in a frame (of actual physical meter sticks) 
moving with the charges is given by 


where 


T? =1+ 
1 


The force measured in the moving frame may be determined by appeal 
to the energy principle, which should remain valid. We must have 


F’- dr’ = Far 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 111 


dh 
and hence poeticp 


By direct substitution of expression (19.5) one finds 


F = J/1 — fp? ad 

r’3 

which, except for the factor JI — f’, has the same form as the electrostatic 
force between two charges at rest. This means that for every dynamical 
configuration of a collection of slow-moving charges, the center of gravity 
of which is at rest, there exists another physically realizable configuration 
in which the center of gravity moves with (arbitrary) velocity v and the 
configuration as a whole is contracted, in the direction of v, by the factor 
e 1 — B*. Lorentz reasoned that since matter is made up of electric charges, 
all bodies must show this contraction. 

It will be noted that although the configuration suffers the Lorentz 
contraction, the orbital motion is slowed down because of the factor 
JI — B*? inthe expression for F’. This is in the right direction to produce 
the time dilation effect, but does not account for all of it. The full effect 
is obtained by postulating, in addition, an increase in all masses by the 
factor 1/\/1 — B2. Ed.] 


21 LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION 


The time dilation can be shown to follow from the Lorentz contraction 
and the principle of relativity. We shall assume not only that the length 
of a rod in a moving system is contracted, but also that the length of a rod 
in a rest system appears contracted to an observer in a moving system. 
This assumption of the relativity of the Lorentz contraction has far reaching 
consequences on our ideas of simultaneity. 

The length of a rod is obtained by finding the coordinates of its end 
points at a certain instant ¢. For a coordinate system in which the rod is 
at rest we have ne en 


For a system in which it is moving, 
l= xi(t’') — x2(t')

and 


112 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


Suppose there is another parallel rod, of equal proper length, which is 
at rest in the primed system. Consider the instant when the left hand ends 
of the rods are in coincidence (see figure). Then the right hand ends will 
not be in coincidence in either frame. An observer in the unprimed system 
sees that the right end of the rod moving with respect to him gives a reading 
of //1 — B?, as measured by his own rod, at the same instant that he 
observes the left ends to be in coincidence. For an observer in the primed 
system, however, these observations are not simultaneous since when he 
left ends of the rods are in coincidence for him, the right end of his own 
rod extends beyond the right end of the rod moving with respect to him. 


Consider two coordinate systems, one moving with respect to the other 
with velocity v along the x axis. From the Lorentz contraction we have 


Jl — p2x' =x —vt (21.1) 
and from the condition of relativity 


V1 — px = x' + ot

We can easily verify this by eliminating x in the first transformation

we have 


c= | — adel + w)| 


This explains the null result in the Kennedy-Thorndyke experiment, since 
for x’ =0 

J1 — B 
We have so far obtained the transformation equations for x and t. The 


Michelson—Morley experiment also tells us that the length perpendicular 
to the direction of motion must be unaltered. Hence 


y=y (21.3) 


vac (21.4) 


t 


The transformations (21.1) to (21.4) constitute the Lorentz transformation. 
This transformation can be obtained from two general postulates: 


1) complete relativity 


2) constancy of the velocity of light 


This method of derivation is first due to Poincaré. The second postulate 
states that for two coordinate systems, one moving relative to the other 
with uniform velocity vy, if 


(x2 — x1)? + G2 — 1)? + (22 — 21)? = 72? 
then 
(x2 — x4)? + (2 — y1)? + (2) — 21)? = c7t”? 


114 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


and vice versa. By a proper choice of the origins of the coordinate system, 
we can write 
Xo —X, HX 


xX, — xX, =x’ 
Thus we can write 


x? + yp? + 2? — c7t? = K7(x’? + yp’? + 2’? — c7t'?) (21.5) 


etc. We want to find the most general transformation satisfying (21.5) and 
compatible with the first postulate. The transformation must be linear, 
since if it were not, there would arise singularities in space and this is 
not permissible; and also a uniform motion in one system would not 
correspond to a uniform motion in another system. 


EXERCISE 25 Prove that in order that a uniform motion in one system correspond to 
a uniform motion in another, the transformation must be linear. 


Further, for a linear function of x, y, z, t to correspond to a linear 
function of x’, y’, 2’, t', K cannot be a function of x, y, z or t. If Kis a 
function of v then due to the principle of relativity, it can only depend on 
the absolute magnitude of v. Moreover, each transformation must have 
an inverse. That is, the product of a transformation to a system with 
velocity v and a transformation to a system with velocity —v must reduce 
to the identity transformation. This implies 


K?*(Iv¥]) K?(|—v|) = 1 
whence 
K? =1 


For a relative velocity along the x axis, the most general transformation 
possible under the above conditions is 


x’ = Ax + Bt 

t'=Cx + Dt (21.6) 
y = Ey 

z’ = Fz 


Now if we take x = t = z = 0 in (21.5) then 


y=y? 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 115 
There is no reason why the direction perpendicular to the velocity should 
change. If it did, the first postulate would be violated. Hence 


E£= +1, andsimilarly F= +1 


We shall take the positive signs, since the negative signs correspond to 
reflection of the coordinate axes. Substituting in (21.5) we have 


A*x? + 2ABxt + B?t? — c?(C?x? + 2CDxt + D?t?) = x?c?t? 
A? — c?C? = 1 
AB—c?CD=0 


B? as c? D2 =a —¢? 
and in addition we have 


—=-v 


if the primed coordinate is moving with velocity v along the positive x 
disection of the unprimed coordinate. Thus we have four equations for 
four unknowns and the solution of these equations is 


A=y 


Day 
y= v1 —# 


With these values, (21.6) are identical with the Eqs. (21.1) to (21.4). They 
can be written in vector form thus: 


where 


r =y{(n-r)n — vt} + {(r —(n-r)p} 


‘ vr 
t=y ars 


where n is a unit vector in the direction of v. 

Einstein gave a physical interpretation of the Lorentz contraction by 
studying the sychronization of clocks. Two clocks, A and B, at rest with 
respect to each other and near together can be said to be synchronized if 


116 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


they read the same. However, if they are not close together, the two clocks 
cannot be observed at once. We must use some kind of a signal. Since the 
velocity of light is constant in all frames, and hence reliable, we use light. 
A signal sent from clock A, when A reads t; , reaches clock B when B reads 
t,, whereupon it is partially reflected and returns to A when A reads f;. 
The clocks are synchronized if 


ts =, te = t, = ty 

or 1 
tz = —(t, + ts) 

2 


It is clear however, that due to the constancy of the velocity of light, two 
clocks synchronized for an observer at rest with respect to them, will not 
be synchronized for a moving observer. 

The time dilation gives rise to a “‘paradox’’. Suppose we have a set of 
identical twins A and B. B is taken on a long journey in a straight line with 
uniform velocity (except for short intervals of time when he is accelerated 
to attain this motion from rest, to reverse his velocity, and to return to 
rest beside A). On return, B will be younger than A, since B’s clock has 
been ticking more slowly than /’s. By relativity, B may be tempted to say 
that it was A who has been in motion and not B so that A should be the 
younger. However, relativity does not apply since there is an asymmetry 
in the problem. B has undergone acceleration, whereas A has not. This 
suffices to resolve the ‘‘ paradox,” although one should be cautioned not 
to assume that the difference in their ages is a function solely of the duration 
and magnitude of B’s acceleration. It depends also on the duration of the 
trip. 

Next let us consider the transformation of velocities. As before, let the 
primed system move with velocity v along the x axis of the unprimed 
system. We know that, if terms of the order v?/c? and higher are neglected, 
we get 


V. = Vito 
where

Now from (21.1) we have

shape:

The paths of light rays passing through the origin are the lines x = +/ 
and these lines divide the plane into four regions which for an observer 
at rest at the origin of the unprimed system represent future, past, and 
elsewhere. The regions called elsewhere are so named since any disturbance 
originating in these regions cannot affect the observer due to the fact that 
no signal can travel faster than light. This representation is called the 
Minkowski diagram. 

It is interesting to compare the above transformation with that of the 
rotation of space axes in a plane

120 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


The Lorentz contraction can be represented in the Minkowski diagram. 
As usual, let the primed system, C’, move with velocity v along the x axis 
of the unprimed system, C. Suppose we have a measuring rod of unit 
length at rest in C, with one end at the origin, and the other at A. The 


Dr 


O i 


world line of the first end is the / axis, and that of the other and is a line 
parallel to the / axis and cuts the x’ axis at A’. We want to show that 0/4’, 
which is the length ‘of the rod as seen by an observer in C’, is of length 


~ 1 — 6?. We cannot compare the lengths of the lines 0A and 0A’ in the 
diagram, since the invariant in this case is 


x? — |? 


and not the sum of the squares of the coordinates, y? + z?, say, as in the 
case of space rotation. We have to find the coordinate x’ of A’ in terms of 
the coordinates x and / of C. 

Now the equation of the x’ axis in C is 


l= px 
and hence for A’ we have l’ = 0, / = fx. The invariant relation 
Ya Se 2 


thus reduces to 


and since we also have x = 1 for A and A’, we obtain 
x = Ji =e p? 


which is just the Lorentz contraction. 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 121 


It can be shown similarly that a rod at rest in C’ appears contracted 
in C. Let OB’ be the length of a unit rod at rest in C. Then the world line 


of B’ will intersect the x axis at B, and we have for it / = 0, /’ = —fx’, 
x’ = 1, so that the invariant gives 
x2 =J—- p? 


and hence the Lorentz contraction.

23 DERIVATION OF THE FRESNEL COEFFICIENT AND THE 
ABERRATION FORMULA 

We shall give here two applications of the velocity addition formula to 
the explanation of two experiments which were important in the develop- 
ment of the theory of relativity. First let us consider Fizeau’s experiment. 
Here the times required for light to travel through water with and against 
its direction of motion are compared. If the water is at rest, the velocity 
in it is simply c/n where n is the index of refraction of water. If the water 
has velocity v, then by (21.8) the light travelling with it has the velocity

for v/c < 1. Thus relativity gives a simple explanation of the Fresnel dragging 
coefficient. 

Next let us consider aberration. Let the reference system C’ move with 
velocity v along the x axis of system C. Suppose a particle has velocity V’ 
making an angle with the x’ axis in C’. We want to calculate these quantities 
in the unprimed system. From (21.8) we have

This is the correct aberration formula which checks with all the experiments. 

It seems a bit remarkable that we can obtain correct formulae by simple 
Lorentz transformation when we consider the complexity of the problem, 
as for instance if we try to obtain the dispersion formula when all the 
electrons are moving uniformly in addition to their harmonic motion. The 
reason we can derive a formula in a coordinate system which is most 
convenient for the calculation and then make a Lorentz transformation to 
get the result in the required system is due to the fact that true physical 
equations hold in all systems. That is, the equations derived that describe 
natural phenomena are invariant under Lorentz transformation. 


24 COVARIANCE 


Let g, stand for any one of the observables r, t, E, H, m, j, etc. in the co- 
ordinate system C with which we are concerned. There is some relationship 
of the form 


A,(q) = 0 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 123 


which expresses a physical law. Let the corresponding value of g in another 
coordinate system C”’ be q’. C and C’ are connected by a Lorentz trans- 
formation. The same law will be expressed in C’ by the equation 

A,(q') = 0 
In general 

q +q 

and J’ is a different function of g’ from A of g. The idea of covariance is 
expressed in the relation 


A,(q) = 0 = 4,(q’) = 0 
This condition is equivalent to the relation 


Ax = 2 Quis 


where |Q,;| + 0, since the vanishing of one set implies the vanishing of 
the other. If the above relation holds for a Lorentz transformation then the 
equation 
A,(q) = 0 
is said to be Lorentz covariant. 
As an illustration consider one of Maxwell’s equations 


V:E —- 420 = 0 
If we make a Lorentz transformation, we will not get 

V-E’ — 4x0’ = 0 
but some more complicated expression. This is because the equation is 
only part of a general law. The other part is 


V Se dept 
c Ot 
and the correct relation is 
1 cE ‘ 
V-E’ — 470" = 9,(V-E — 420) tra (¥ are a ‘i 
c 
where q, and p, are certain scalar and vector constants respectively. 
We have seen that the Lorentz transformation mixes up the time and the 
space coordinates. Thus 


(x’, y’, 2’, ') = O(x, y, z, t) 


124 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


and we found that Q, the matrix of the transformation can be written in 
the form 


xXx yz cet

If we let x1, x?, x3, x* stand for x, y, z, ct, then 
(x*)' = Q)x" 


where yu stands for any one of 1, 2, 3, 4, and we are using the summation 
convention that two repeated indices, one upper and one lower, on the 
same side of the equation are to be summed from one to four. Q*% is the 
element in the wth row and vth column of the matrix Q given above. 

Any set of four quantities A” which transform according to the law 


(A*)’ = QYA’ (24.2) 
is called a contravariant 4-vector. If x, stands for x', x?, x3, —x*, for 


uu = 1,2, 3,4, respectively, then x, is said to form a covariant 4-vector. 


Now

invariant 


An invariant is a scalar quantity which remains unaltered during any 
transformation of the coordinate system. A set of 4 quantities B,, which 
transform like x, is called a covariant 4-vector. It is clear that 


A*B,, = invariant 
The set of 16 quantities A*B” transform according to the law 
(A“B’)’ = O40" A*B” (24.3) 


and is said to form a tensor of second rank. In the same way, a tensor of 
arbitrarily high rank can be formed by taking the product of vectors thus 


A“BC,D" 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 125 


and they transform according to the law 
(A“B’C,D" ...)’ = Q%050%07 ... A*B°C,D? ... (24.4) 


Such a complicated set of quantities does not usually occur in nature, but 
symmetric and antisymmetric tensors of second rank are frequent. The 
former is such that each element is unaltered by the interchange of the 
indices x, v, and so has 10 independent components; the latter is such 
that each element merely changes sign by the interchange of wu and » and 
has 6 independent components. In classical mechanics, the Q* are uniquely 
determined since they connect observable quantities; in quantum mechanics, 
however, since the wave function y, is not an observable, but only the 
square of its absolute value is, the sign of its transformation coefficients is 
undetermined. 

The values of Q% are greatly restricted since the Lorentz transformations 
form a group. That is, the sucessive application of two transformations L 
and L’ must be equivalent to another Lorentz transformation L’’. Thus

(x)! = Q"x”

ES , UAE 

QO, = O29; (24.5) 
It turns out that all quantities arising in electromagnetic theory transform 
according to laws involving the matrix Q% or product of Q’s. A physical 
law may be written in covariant form, but its validity must be tested by 
experiment. 

Consider a general tensor of second rank 


and therefore

We can write it as a sum of 3 parts which are themselves tensors. First 
we can Separate it into the symmetric and antisymmetric components

S” has 10 and A” has 6 independent components. This separation is 
preserved under a Lorentz transformation since the transformation matrix

where S” has 9 independent components, A“” has 6, and 6”’S% has one. 
The antisymmetric part A”” can be thought of as a 4-dimensional generaliza- 
tion of the vector product since 4-vectors B“ and C* may always be found 
such that 

A’ = BEC” — C"B’ 


It may also be regarded as a surface vector, since the six independent 
components are the projections on the six coordinate planes of the area 
determined by B*’ and C”. 

Another type of tensor which occasionally occurs is a completely anti- 
symmetrical tensor of the third rank, 7“”. The components of such a 
tensor vanish unless all three indices are different. Therefore it has only 
4 independent components, and they can be characterized by the missing 
index.

25 TRANSFORMATION LAWS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC 
QUANTITIES 


Let us now apply the ideas developed in the last section to write Maxwell’s 
equations in covariant form and to see how the quantities which occur 
in it transform under a Lorentz transformation. We have 


V:-H=0 (25.1) 
CELL ees eee (25.2) 
c Ct 
V-E = 4x0 (25.3) 
1 cE 
Vx H--— — =4aj 25. 
c Ct : 4) 


Let us first consider (25.3) and (25.4). We know that (0, /) must transform 
to (9’, j’), and that they must do so in such a way that, if the charge is at 
rest in the unprimed system (that is j = 0) then 


Vv 

« _, Go 

J) ~ 
Cc 


to the first order in v/c. We are using the subscript 0 to indicate quantities 
measured in the rest system. Now the total charge | o dV must also be an 


invariant. We would meet with great difficulties if this were not so. Since 


128 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


the volume contracts by the factor vi — v?/c?, we must have 
' @ 
oS 
wi —v?|c? 


Thus @ transforms like t, and so we are led to make the guess that (j, 0) 
form a contravariant 4-vector j”. Then 


(j*)’ = Gis)’ = viz + Bro 
G7) =) =h4 

(7*)’ = (i)! =i: 

(i*)’ = 0' = yo + Brix 


This transformation law guarantees both the invariance of the total charge 
and the reduction to correct values for low velocities. 

The same argument may be given in another way. (j,@) satisfy a con- 
servation law 


—-=4+V-j=0 (25.5) 


which must be covariant under Lorentz transformations, and this is the 
case if (j, 0) form a contravariant vector since then (25.5) can be written as 


ej” = 0 (25.6) 


Thus the right sides of (25.3) and (25.4) form a contravariant 4-vector. 
The left sides have differential operators ¢@,, so that the simplest way of 
writing the equations in covariant form is 


be? 


0,F!* = 4qj" (25.7) 


Since only 6 quantities E, H occur on the left, we suspect F,, to be an 
antisymmetric tensor. To find F,, in terms of E, H let us introduce the 
potentials A and @ such that 

H=VxA 


Then (25.1) and (25.2) are satisfied identically. A, g are not uniquely 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 129 


determined by these equations since 


A’=A4+VA 
rae _1 6A 
c Ot 


where A is any scalar function, give the same value of E and H. We guess 
that A, » form a 4-vector, and from the fact that 


A, =A,+0,A 
p=p — O4,A 


We see that they form a contravariant 4-vector, ¢“. It may be noted here 
that when we obtain the transformation laws of the potentials, the whole 
problem of finding the field of a moving charge reduces to that of finding 
it for a static distribution, and then applying a Lorentz transformation. 


Consider the equation 
O,Pu — 99, = Fy, (25.8) 


Replacing the derivatives of the potential by the field quantities, we get 
Fy, = —F,, = A, 
Fi; = —Fy, = —H, 
Fy3 = —F32 = H, 
Fy, = —Fig = —Ey 
Fy, = —Fy4 = —E, 
F43 = —Fy, = =r 
and writing F,,, in matrix form we have

Raising both indices to F” gives the same matrix except that the signs

The other set of Maxwell’s Eqs. (25.1) and (25.2) can also be written in 
covariant form. 
V-H=0 
written in terms of F,,, is 


0, F23 + 02F3; + 03F,2 = 0 


Note that the Index 4 is missing and that the indices 1, 2, 3 are cyclically 
permuted. Let us write an analogous equation in which the index 1 is 
missing. 
02F 34 + 03F 42 + O4F23 = 0

where yp, A, v are all different. This is a completely antisymmetric tensor of 
third rank and is equivalent to a 4 vector. We can write the equation as a 
divergence of a tensor by introducing the dual of F,,. The dual G* of a 
tensor F,,, is defined as 
Cee aaa (25.11) 


where e*“” is the antisymmetric unit tensor of the fourth rank. Its com- 
ponents vanish unless all 4 indices are different, and the nonvanishing 
components equal +1 or —1 according as «Buy form an even or an odd 
permutation of 1, 2, 3, 4. In terms of G*? Maxwell’s Eqs. (25.1) and (25.2) 
can be written 

6,G* = 0 (25.12) 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 131

Each of the four independent values of « leads to one of the Eq. (25.10) 


which have already been shown to be equivalent to (25.1) and (25.2). 
If we introduce the complex tensor 


K% = Fe ap G* 
then the whole set of Maxwell’s equations can be written 
0,K™ = 4nj" (25.13) 


The real part gives (25.3) and (25.4), and the imaginary part gives (25.1) 


and (25.2). 
From the tensor equations we find the following transformation equations 


for E and H: 


E| = E,

EXERCISE 29 Check the rest of the transformation formulae for E and H. 


Let us now apply the above formulae to find the field of a uniformly 
moving point charge, and check the results obtained in section 11. Let a 
charged particle be at rest in the primed system, and denote its position 
in this system by r, = (x, y,, 2). We shall denote the point where we 
want the field by r; = (x‘, y’, 2’). Then 


H’ = 0 
EK’ = e(r, ae a) 
Iro = F.|? 


To find the field in the unprimed system, in which the particle is moving 
with velocity v along the positive x axis, we transform the two sides of the 
equation. For the right side,

These equations are seen to be identical with (11.6) and (11.7). We note 
that E is perpendicular to H, and where v is close to c we have |H| ~ |E]. 
Moreover, if E, is the magnitude of the electric field at a given distance 
from the saiticles in the particle’s “equatorial plane” and E, is the magnitude 
of the field at the same distance along the “polar axis” (i.e., the line of 
motion) then 

E, =(1- p?)3/2 E, 


Therefore the electromagnetic field of the particle approaches more and 
more to that of a radiation field as v approaches c. 


26 APPLICATION TO THE METHOD OF VIRTUAL QUANTA 


Consider an atomic system of dimension d, bombarded by a stream of 
charged particles with velocity approaching that of light. When a particle 
passes by, the effect is much the same as if a pulse of electromagnetic 
radiation passed by. There is this difference, that in the case of particles 
there is no phase relation between the effects of different particles while 
there js a relation for the radiation field. But in such phenomena as ab- 
sorption, this does not make any difference. Thus by making a Fourier 
analysis of the perpendicular component of the particle field, we can find 
what kind of electromagnetic waves it is equivalent to, and if we know what 
happens when the atomic system is irradiated by electromagnetic radiation 
of the corresponding frequencies, we can easily find what happens when 
the same system is bombarded by high energy charged particles.

logarithmic function, the result is rather insensitive to the error in them.

2) Bremsstrahlung from very high energy electrons. This is the calculation 
of the cross-section for radiation by an electron accelerated in the field 
of a nucleus of charge Ze. The straightforward calculation is very difficult 
if the electron has high energy, and we resort to a trick. We make a Lorentz 
transformation to a system in which the electron is at rest. Then the nucleus 
goes by the electron at a high velocity, and to the electron, the field of the 
nucleus will appear as a highly contracted electromagnetic wave pulse. 
This wave will be scattered by the electron, and the electron will suffer a 
compton recoil. If we transform back to the system in which the nucleus 
is at rest, the recoil of the electron becomes its deflection, and the scattered 
pulse becomes the Bremsstrahlung. 

Let » be the frequency of a virtual quantum, and » the frequency of 
the corresponding scattered quantum. » is a function of v9 and the angle of

3) Pair formation by y-rays in a nuclear field. As a consequency of Dirac’s 
electron theory, an electron-positron pair can be produced when two 
quanta of radiation collide. The cross section for pair formation when the 
two photons have just enough energy to create a pair is 


Using the method of virtual quanta, we can find the cross section for pair 
formation when a very high energy y-ray passes near a nucleus. We trans- 
form to a Lorentz frame in which the frequency of the y-ray is » = mc?/h. 
The nucleus is then traveling with velocity v ~ c, and its field will contain 
virtual quanta of frequency » = mc?/h. The interaction between the y-ray 
and the virtual quanta will result in pair production. It is found by this 
method that the probability of making pairs by a single y-ray of energy 
about 10° e.v. in the field of a nucleus is a few per cent of that by two 
y-rays of energy ~mc?.

27 APPLICATION TO THE THEORY OF THE CERENKOV EFFECT 


We saw in the last section (26.1) that the Fourier component of the trans- 
verse electric field of a charged particle moving along the x-axis has the 
factor 


2nirx 
v 


Thus it is equivalent to a wave motion with propagation vector 


v v 


k,=—-—> 


v c 
Hence

=ki+k+ki>— 

c2 

For an electromagnetic field in free space, k* = v?/c?, and this is the 

reason no matter how large the energy, a particle moving uniformly in 

free space cannot radiate. The field has too much momentum for its energy. 

However, in a dielectric the propagation vector of an electromagnetic 
wave Satisfies the relation 


k? = » m= index of refraction 


and this relation can be satisfied by high energy electrons. The radiation 


from them has been observed by Cerenkov. 
Let us consider an electron moving along the x-axis with velocity v. 
Then the current j is parallel to v and is given by the relation 


fe = (x — vt) (y) (2) (27.1) 
c 


In section 7 we derived the expression (7.11) for the total radiation emitted 
in frequency range dv and in solid angle dQ. In this formula, » is the circular 
frequency, and, if we write it in terms of the actual frequency, we get 


{le dt {i x n] elt zea)? ogy 


Qn 


Bid 


dQ, dv = dv dQ 


The formula for the case where the system is immersed in a dielectric of 
refractive index n is obtained by replacing c by c/n in the two places where 
c occurs in the above formula. This follows from the fact that the wave 
equation satisfied by E and H in a medium with dielectric constant « and 


140 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS

2 
& OE og 4n Oj,

so that the velocity of the propagation is clV einstead of c, and from the 
definition of n, this equals c/n. This justifies the substitution of c/n for c in 
the exponential. Further, in the equation 

1 oH 

——+VxE=0 

c Ot 
the differentiation with respect to the space coordinates brings down a 
factor n/c instead of 1/c so that 

|H| = 7 |E| 
Now the Poynting vector 
S=—ExH 
4n 
is the same in a dielectric as in free space since the tangential components 
of E and H are continuous at the boundary of a dielectric, and the normal 
flow of energy at the boundary must be continuous. This means that n 
must occut as a factor in (27.2), and so we replace c by c/n there. 
Let us specify the direction of the radiation by the angles ¢, 6, with 

respect to the x-axis. Then if « = cos 6, we have

If we take the integral over ¢ from — © to oo, we would get

and if this value is substituted in dQ, and the total radiation calculated, 
we would get an infinite value. This is to be expected since it means that 
the electron radiates for an infinite time. Instead we shall take the limits 
of integration to be from —T to +T where T > 1/v. Then

It is now easy to see that the equation

Thus (28.7) is the covariant form of the conservation equations. 

Let us suppose that we have some electromagnetic radiation in a finite 
region of space so that E and H exist in this region but are zero everywhere 
else. Then the integrals 


E= | Tide

exist. We shall show that (p, E/c) = p, is a covariant 4-vector if there are 
no charges in the region where the fields are not zero. 
The proof is as follows: We have

everywhere, and 
T’ =0 


on the boundary of the region under consideration. Let A’ be a vector 
such that

everywhere and

on the boundary. Applying Gauss’s theorem to the 4-dimensional diver- 
gence of a 4-vector, we obtain from

where S is the 3-dimensional surface in the 4-dimensional volume. Let us 
choose this volume to be a cylinder parallel to the x* axis. Then the base is 
the 3-dimensional volume in ordinary space. The cylinder is to be bounded 
by a section x* = constant and by another section x* = constant, where 
x*’ denotes the time measured by an observer on a coordinate system 
moving with respect to the original system. The normal components are 
— A* and (A*)’ on these surfaces, and zero on the walls of the cylinder. 
Hence we have

That is 
If A* dx! dx? dx? = invariant 


Now if we let

where Db” is an arbitrary, constant vector, we see that the conditions on A” 
are satisfied, and hence 


b’ if T¢ dr = invariant 


and since b” is arbitrary, we may conclude that

Let w and 9 denote the momentum and energy densities of a charged 
body. We know that at low velocities, they satisfy the following equations

We have introduced 3 different forces and we shall summarize their 
properties: 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 149 


1) f*=(f, E-j), where f is the force density, is a contravariant 4-vector 
and equals the time rate of change of momentum density for uw = 1, 2,3 
and 1/c times the time rate of change of the energy density for u = 4. 


2) F* =| f*"dro, where dry is an element of proper volume, is a con-

for uw = 4. 


3) ¥ =~/1 — f’F is the actual force and equals the time rate of change

that

The transformation formulae for the mass and momentum of a particle 
can also be obtained from purely kinematical reasoning. We consider the 
collision of two particles, and demand that in the collision, both energy 
and momentum be conserved for an observer in any system. The required 
result can be obtained by considering the simple case of the head-on 
collision of two perfectly elastic particles with equal rest mass. Then there 
is one reference system in which the particles have equal and opposite 
velocities, say u and —u before the collision, and after collision separate 
with velocities —u and u. For an observer moving with velocity —V with 
respect to this system and parallel to the direction of motions of the particles, 
the initial velocities v, and v2 are given by 


In the first reference frame, there is some instant during the collision 
when the two particles are in contact and are at rest. Hence since the 
effective (or inertial) mass m can depend only on the absolute value of the 
velocity, we have 

2m(u) = My 


m(u) u + m(u)(—u) = 0 


In the second reference frame, at some instant the two bodies are together 
and have a common velocity V; hence 


m(v,) + m(v,) = M 
m(v,) 0, + m(v2) v2 = MV 


In a sense, we are defining mass by these equations in such a way that it 
is conserved. We are considering mass instead of energy as it is more 
convenient to do so, and we shall show later the connection between mass

It must be pointed out here that the mass considered above is inertial 
mass, and the mass usually measured is gravitational mass. However, the 
EGtvés experiment has shown that these two masses are equivalent to a 
very high degree of precision. 

The relation (29.1) between energy and mass has been checked experi- 
mentally in several cases. We know that positrons have the same rest mass 
as electrons and at low velocities the former combine with electrons to 
form y-rays. The energy of the y-rays have been measured and shown to 
agree with the value predicted by the theory

to about one per cent. There is no factor of 2 since two particles of mass mo 
give rise to two quanta of this energy. This is necessary in order that 
momentum be conserved. We note that in this process the whole mass is 
converted to radiation energy. The inverse process does not give a good 
check since the curve giving the relation between the y-ray energy and the 
number of particles produced does not have a sharp threshold at the 
minimum energy required for pair production.

30 CONSIDERATIONS IMPORTANT FOR THE QUANTUM THEORY 


In this section we shall give a few considerations to show how the classical 
electromagnetic theory developed in this course has to be modified when 
quantum mechanical effects are considered. 

I We have seen in section 18 that if H(p, x) is the Hamiltonian function 
for a particle with charge e when there is no external field acting on it, 
then its expression when there is a field is given by 


HW =p + H(p~ £4,3) 
c 


so that a 
p=m+—A 
c 


156 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


and we have also

where F is the Lorentz force. From relativistic considerations, we have

Also 4

Now since p, E/c and A, y both form contravariant 4-vectors, any linear 
combination of them also forms one, and hence 


2 
Ge (» st a) — (E — eg)? = invariant 
c 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 157 


We find the value of this invariant by setting £ = H’ and using the expression 
for H’ above. This gives 


es 
c? (P - <a) — (E — eg)? = —mict 
c 


Now this equation has not only the solution 


eg + c. mbe? + (» — <a) 
c 

2 é : 

ep —c_| moc? + (» — <a) 
é 


and this Hamiltonian gives the same equation of motion as H’ if the signs 
of e and p are changed. Thus H” corresponds to the Hamiltonian of a 
particle with the opposite charge and negative mass. In classical physics 
we can say that this does not correspond to any reality and throw this 
solution away; in quantum mechanics, however, it is connected with the 
theory of the positron. These anomalous solutions (H”) are the classical 
origin of the phenomenon of pair production. 

II The oscillations of a plane wave are given by the factor 


E= H' 


but also the solution 


E=H" 


e2mitk -r—vt) 


Since the phase must be independent of the motion of the observer, we 


have ; : 
k-r — vt = invariant 


and since r, ct form a contravariant 4-vector, k, »/c must also form a 
contravariant 4-vector. Thus 


p = const xk 
are covariant relations. DeBroglie wrote 
E=h, p = hk 


According to the quantum theory any system with well-defined E and p 
has connected with it well-defined values of » and k. This means that in 
making a Lorentz transformation, we get the same result whether we use 
the Doppler effect for » or the transformation formula for E. 


158 LECTURES ON ELECTRODYNAMICS 


III We know from section 3 that any radiation field may be expanded 
in terms of plane waves. Planck showed that plane waves can only be 
excited with integral multiples of a discrete energy. Thus 


Ey. Pao Nhy 


where N is an integral number. Moreover Compton showed that plane 
waves have momentum 
Prov = Nhk 


The energy E, in the k'" Fourier component of a field oscillator is given by 


1 
E, = = (Ex + Hy) 


IU 
and if A, is this component of the vector potential, then since 


H=VxA 
we have \ 
Ex = — (Eq + 407k? Ap) 
82 
Let us compare this expression with the corresponding expression for a 
mechanical oscillator of unit mass 


We can make the following correspondence 
E;,< p 
A,oq 
21k > w 


For the mechanical oscillator, no quantum mechanical effects are observed 
when it is highly excited. Thus in any phenomenon where a large number 
of quanta of radiation are present, we expect classical theory to hold. 
Roughly, this means that classical electromagnetic theory holds for low 
frequencies. 

Let us see how the classical theory breaks down. In the quantum theory, 
we have the complementary relation between position and momentum of a 


ticl 
particle Ap Nps 


SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 159 


For a well defined p, q is spread out, and for well defined q, p is spread out. 
Making the correspondences, we have the complementarity 


AE, AA, = hie 


where the factor c comes in from the consideration of units. Since A, 
gives rise to a magnetic field H, to E,, this expresses a complementarity 
between E and the component of H perpendicular to it. Also, if the energy E 
of a harmonic oscillator is fixed, p and q fluctuate. Similarly, if £,, is 
fixed, E and H fluctuate. 

In classical theory, it is assumed that E and H can be measured with 
arbitrary precision. This is not possible in quantum theory. In the actual 
measurement of E, we have to take a certain volume and take a certain 
interval of time 7 and take the average. Thus

One method is to take a charged body and measure its momentum at the 
beginning and at the end of the time interval 7. Then 
p(T) — p(0) = eVET 


In order that the body stay near one position, we must take the mass large, 
and in order that its own field not modify the external field which we want 
to measure, we must take o very small. In classical theory these conditions 
can be fulfilled, and we can make the test bodies so feeble that we can 
measure E and H at neighboring points without disturbing each other. In 
quantum theory, however, this is not possible since each momentum 
measurement brings in an uncertainty in the position such that 


Op = h/dx 
oVOET 2 h/bx 
VT OE 6x = h/o 


and for V, T, 6£, 6x to be small, o must be large. In fact, if the measurement 
is to have any meaning, we must have 


dx < vil? 


Thus 


If @ is made large, then the self-field of the test body alters the external 
field. However, we can compensate this effect by having a similar body 
charged with equal and opposite charge, and fixed in space at the place

where the field is being measured. Since there is an uncertainty 6x in the 
position of the test body, its field will not be entirely cancelled out, but 
there will be a dipole moment proportional to 6x. Since 6x is unknown 
the force on the test body which is proportional to 6x is also unknown. 
However, the constant of proportionality can be calculated, and if the test 
body is attached to the compensating body by a spring with an elastic 
constant equal to this value, then the uncertainty in position will give no 
net force on the test body, and the field can be measured to arbitrary 
precision by using a high enough charge density. 

The dipole moment disturbs the value of H nearby, and so gives com- 
plementarity between E and H. Now a current in the x direction only 
gives a magnetic field in the yz plane; thus the complementarity is between 
the perpendicular components of E and H. The parallel components are 
not complementary. It can also be shown that two measurements of the 
field do not disturb each other if the one lies in the “‘absolute elsewhere”’ 
(Minkowski diagram) of the other. This is to be expected since then no 
electromagnetic disturbance which originates at the position and time of 
the measurement can reach the place of the other measurement at the time 
when this measurement is being made. Another result which can be proved 
is that if there are a large number of quanta such that

k~V 33 yn T 
then the fields due to these quanta of radiation can be measured to a 
small fraction of their values. 

As an illustration of the complementarity between E and energy, let us 
consider the photoelectric effect. It is found that no matter how low the 
intensiv of the radiation, the electrons are always ejected with energy 


E,=hv -I 


where / is the binding force of the electron to the atom. This ejection is 
due to the force 
eE 


and we would expect classically that since E decreases with decreasing 
intensity, we will get a smaller value of E,. However, due to complemen- 
tarity, if the energy of the radiation is well defined, the field fluctuates 
violently, and though it takes on large values less frequently for lower 
intensities, the energy with which the electrons come out is the same, 
though their number is proportional to the intensity.
