    <div class="header-gray"><b>POST /wopi/files/<i>(file_id)</i></b></div>
    <p class="dscr">Renames a file.</p>
    <p>This operation works as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The WOPI host checks if a file is currently locked or not.</li>
        <li>If the file is currently <b>locked</b> and the <b>X-WOPI-Lock</b> value does not match the lock currently on the file, 
        the host must return <b>409 Conflict</b> (<em>"lock mismatch"</em>) and include the <b>X-WOPI-Lock</b> response header containing the value of the current lock on the file.</li>
        <li>If the file is <b>unlocked</b>, the host should respond with <b>200 OK</b> and proceed with the rename.</li>
        <li>If the host cannot rename the file because the name requested is invalid or conflicts with the existing file, the host should try to generate a different name 
        based on the requested name that meets the file name requirements.</li>
        <li>If the host cannot generate a different name, it should return <b>400 Bad Request</b>. The response must include the <b>X-WOPI-InvalidFileNameError</b> header 
        that describes why the file name was invalid.</li>
    </ol>
