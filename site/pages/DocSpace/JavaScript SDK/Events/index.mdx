When initializing the SDK frame, a number of events can be passed to the configuration, which will be executed at the appropriate moment:

## Events and their description:

* **onAppError** - the function called when SDK is initialized with an error. This error is returned during the initialization.

  Example

  ```
  var onAppError = function () {
      console.log("ONLYOFFICE DocSpace reports an error");
  };

  var docSpace = DocSpace.SDK.initManager({
      "events": {
          "onAppError": null,
          ...
      },
      ...
  });
  ```

* **onAppReady** - the function called when SDK is initialized successfully.

  Example

  ```
  var onAppReady = function () {
      console.log("ONLYOFFICE DocSpace is ready");
  };

  var docSpace = DocSpace.SDK.initManager({
      "events": {
          "onAppReady": null,
          ...
      },
      ...
  });
  ```

* **onCloseCallback** - the function called only in the [room-selector](/docspace/jssdk/initmodes/roomselector) and [file-selector](/docspace/jssdk/initmodes/fileselector) modes when the room or file selector is closed or the selection is canceled.

  Example

  ```
  var onCloseCallback = function () {
      console.log("The room selector is closed.");
  };

  var docSpace = DocSpace.SDK.initRoomSelector({
      "events": {
          "onCloseCallback": null,
          ...
      },
      ...
  });
  ```

* **onSelectCallback** - the function called only in the [room-selector](/docspace/jssdk/initmodes/roomselector) and [file-selector](/docspace/jssdk/initmodes/fileselector) modes when a room or file is selected.

  Example

  ```
  var onSelectCallback = function () {
      console.log("The 'New room' room was selected.");
  };

  var docSpace = DocSpace.SDK.initRoomSelector({
      "events": {
          "onSelectCallback": null,
          ...
      },
      ...
  });
  ```

  The information about the selected item is returned:

  ```
  {
      "icon": "https://example.com/url-to-example-image.svg",
      "id": 34,
      "isSelected": false,
      "label": "roomName"
  }
  ```

  where **example.com** is the name of the server with the ONLYOFFICE DocSpace installed.
