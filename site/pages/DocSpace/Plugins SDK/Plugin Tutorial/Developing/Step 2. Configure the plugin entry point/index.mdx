The [index.ts](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/blob/master/speech-to-text/src/index.ts) plugin entry point will be created automatically in the [src](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/speech-to-text/src) folder during the template creation step. This file is required.

This file contains all the basic methods of the plugin types that you selected in the previous step. You can change this file at any time.

If you create a plugin yourself, without a template, for the plugin entry point, you can use the code from our ready-made plugin samples. It will work perfectly.
