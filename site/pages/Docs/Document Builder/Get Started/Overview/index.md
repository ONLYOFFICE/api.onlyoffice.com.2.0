**ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** is a C++ library used to create and edit Office Open XML format files (documents, spreadsheets and presentations) and save them to DOCX, XSLX, PPTX and PDF formats.

It allows you to build a document easily without the need to actually run a document processing editor. It also allows the developers to automate document building using the templates you create or inserting the data from some database of yours into a document or a set of documents. It has all the features of a common document editor but is lightweight and can be easily integrated into your document management system, CRM system, etc. using its [JavaScript API](../../../../Docs/Office%20API/Get%20Started/index.md).

## How to use

There are two ways to use ONLYOFFICE Document Builder in your own project:

1. Integrate this library into your own application. To get ONLYOFFICE Document Builder, visit [this page](../Get%20Document%20Builder/index.md).

   After you download and unpack the files, the library is ready for [integration](../../Builder%20Framework/Overview/index.md).

2. Use [Builder.App](../../Builder%20App/Overview/index.md), the provided executive binary wrapper for an easy start. The latest versions of executable files can always be downloaded [here](https://www.onlyoffice.com/document-builder.aspx?from=api). After the file download, run it and see the examples of how ONLYOFFICE Document Builder can be used without the need to write any application.
