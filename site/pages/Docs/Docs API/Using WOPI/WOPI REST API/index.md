[WOPI REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/cloud-storage-partner-program/rest/) specifies a set of operations that enables a client to access and change files stored on a server.

ONLYOFFICE Docs uses the following WOPI operations:

* [CheckFileInfo](/editors/wopi/restapi/checkfileinfo) - returns information about the file properties, access rights and editor settings.
* [GetFile](/editors/wopi/restapi/getfile) - requests a message to retrieve a file for the *HTTP://server/<...>/wopi\*/files/\<id>/contents* operation.
* [Lock](/editors/wopi/restapi/lock) - locks file editing by an online office that requested the lock.
* [RefreshLock](/editors/wopi/restapi/refreshlock) - refreshes the lock on a file by resetting its automatic expiration timer to 30 minutes.
* [Unlock](/editors/wopi/restapi/unlock) - allows for file editing.
* [PutFile](/editors/wopi/restapi/putfile) - requests a message to update a file for the *HTTP://server/<...>/wopi\*/files/\<id>/contents* operation.
* [PutRelativeFile](/editors/wopi/restapi/putrelativefile) - creates a new file on the host based on the current file.
* [RenameFile](/editors/wopi/restapi/renamefile) - renames a file.
