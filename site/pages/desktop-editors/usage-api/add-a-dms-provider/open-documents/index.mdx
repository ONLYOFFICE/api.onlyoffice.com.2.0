After [registering](/desktop/addingdms/loginlogout) in the cloud, you can start working on documents stored there.

Connecting ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors to your cloud allows you to edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations without having a constant Internet connection and easily switch to the online mode for real-time co-editing (in case [ONLYOFFICE Docs](/editors/basic) is integrated with your cloud).

Besides, using ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors you are no longer limited by your browser resources. It means you can:

* copy and paste from/into another document using the editor toolbar buttons and context menu options;
* print the document directly from the app using the **Print** option;
* use all the fonts available on the local computer;
* work with documents without prior manual language setting (it is set automatically).

To open a document in a new window / tab correctly:

**Option 1.** Use the *window\.open("http\://url.to.document")* JavaScript command, where URL to the document is validated by the *editorPage* value of the [config](/desktop/addingdms/). The document will be opened upon successful validation.

**Option 2.** Use the *open:document* command of the [execCommand](/desktop/execcommand) method. When this command is sent, the document is opened. Parameters are specified in the format of a string with the serialized *json* as follows:

```
{
    "url" : "url to document",
    "type" : "type",
    "provider" : "provider"
} 
```
