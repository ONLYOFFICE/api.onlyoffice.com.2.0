# Debugging

You can debug any Document Builder [component](/docbuilder/basic#builder-components). To do this, follow the instructions below.

## Executing from a browser (for plugins and macros)

1. Open the **Plugins** tab and click **Macros**.

2. Use the **debugger** command in your script:

   ```
   debugger;
   var oDocument = Api.GetDocument();
   var oParagraph = oDocument.GetElement(0);
   oParagraph.AddText("Hello world!");
   ```

3. Open the developer console by pressing the **F12** button.

4. Press the **Run** button to run your script.

   Please note that the **debugger** command will only work if the development tools are open. Otherwise, the browser will ignore it. ![Builder debugger](/content/img/docbuilder/builder-debugger.png)

The **debugger** command works as a breakpoint and pauses the execution at the script point where this command is inserted.

## Executing from Builder.Framework or Builder.App

This instruction can also be used for any [Builder.Framework](/docbuilder/framework) version: C++, COM, .Net.

1. Open a terminal in the *DocumentBuilder* folder.

2. Set the **V8\_USE\_INSPECTOR** environment variable to 1:

   Windows

   ```
   SET V8_USE_INSPECTOR=1
   ```

   Linux

   ```
   export  V8_USE_INSPECTOR=1
   ```

3. Run the Builder script with the **docbuilder** command:

   ```
   docbuilder script.docbuilder
   ```

4. A link will appear in the terminal. You must open it in your Chrome/Chromium browser to connect to the JavaScript context.

5. Set the breakpoints by clicking the line numbers and run your script again.

6. Now you can debug the executed methods.
