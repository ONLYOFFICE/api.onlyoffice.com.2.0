## Running the application

Starting from version 7.1, you can run ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors with the *--ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep* flag. It can have the following values:

Parameters

| Value   | Description                                                | Usage                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Runs the application.                                      | --ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep=1       |
| 0       | Stops the application.                                     | --ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep=0       |
| default | The default application condition - the app is turned off. | --ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep=default |

To launch ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors with this flag, use the same instructions as for the *--ascdesktop-support-debug-info* flag [above](#system-instructions). The only difference is that the *--ascdesktop-support-debug-info-keep* flag stores the value passed to it. You will not need to specify it every time you run the application.
